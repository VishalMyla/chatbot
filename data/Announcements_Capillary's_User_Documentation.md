Hi there,

‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs cookin‚Äô, good lookin‚Äô?‚Äù - said no one ever to a documentation portal. Until today.

We‚Äôre pumped to be launching our labor of love and the knock-out update - a whole new experience for the documentation portal! This one is for all the visible and invisible people within your organisation who make every retention a success. Here are the top highlights:

1. Navigation made of dreams

Organisation hassles are out of the way. Each product and feature documentation will now be split and nested within Capillary‚Äôs product pillars. Whatever you‚Äôre looking for, will be there waiting for you in a neat, intuitive sticky left panel.

2. Think it, search it, find it

No matter where you are, the search box will always be with you, waiting for you to talk to it. This is the quickest way for you to find answers to all questions of life Capillary.

3. Developer special: APIs made legendary

API documentation simplified navigation and hierarchical management of all API documentation, not just single pages lost in the noise.

Whichever API you pick, you can get a ready-to-go code for it in every language!

And in the most legendary part of the update: With the single-click ‚ÄúTry it‚Äù button, you can create the entire API codebase for every parameter used in real-time - all within the documentation and in every language! üòØ

Test it here, or test it on Postman, it‚Äôs got your back!

These were the 3 key highlights, but you‚Äôll see many more experiential updates across the portal. The documentation content is more polished and so are the tables of content for all the products. Give us a shout-out when you find something you love.
