# Assigning Permission Set to Users

Organisation Owners have access to all permission sets by default, as they hold the highest level of privileges in the system. Admin Users receive their permission sets from Organisation Owners, while Standard Users can be assigned permission sets by either an Admin User or an Organisation Owner. Admin Users can only assign permissions that they have.

The permission sets can be assigned during the following scenarios:

- User CreationWhen adding a new user, the organisation or admin owner can select the relevant standard or custom permission set(s) to be applied. The selected permission set(s) will define the user's access privileges.

- User UpdateFor existing Admin and Standard users, you can modify the assigned permission set(s) as needed.
