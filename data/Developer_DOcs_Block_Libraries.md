# Block Libraries

A Block Library in Neo enables users to create reusable, standardized blocks that can be utilized across different dataflows without the need to reconfigure them each time. This addresses the challenge of replicating blocks with similar configurations across multiple dataflows or rules.

# Features

- Reusability:Allow users to build blocks with specific configurations once and then reuse them in various dataflows. This avoids duplication of effort and promotes efficiency.

- Standardization:Ensures that certain functionalities or integrations are implemented consistently across different dataflows.

- Central Management:The Block Library acts as a central repository for these reusable components, making them easier to find, manage, and update.

- Versioning and Approval: Block Libraries are version-controlled and follow an approval process.

- Integration with Rules/Dataflows:Once approved, blocks from the library can be easily imported and used within rule versions or dataflows.

- Global Library:There is also a Global Library with predefined, read-only blocks managed at a higher organizational level.

# Global Block Libraries & Org-Specific Block Library

Global Block Library:Global Library includes a set of pre-defined uneditable blocks managed by the Capillary Technology organization and is available for use across organisations, in that particular cluster. Blocks in the Global Library are read-only within your current organization. You can use these blocks in your dataflows, but you cannot modify their configurations directly.

Org-specific Block Library- These libraries are created and managed within individual organizations. Users with the appropriate Neo Edit Access can create and update blocks in these libraries. Updates to these blocks are allowed only when the library version is in the draft state.

# Block Library Versioning

Block libraries are version-controlled. By default, the versionv1is available in theDraftstate, allowing users with edit access to add blocks.

`v1`

`Draft`

When a Neo Admin approves a version under review, the system automatically creates a new version with the next consecutive number. This new version starts in theDraftstate and is a copy of the recently approved version, allowing further modifications.

`Draft`

## Switching Library Versions in Dataflows

Once a dataflow is approved, you cannot change its block library version. To use a different block library version, you must create a new dataflow and link it to the updated library version.

## Linking Library to Dataflows

A block library is linked to a specific dataflow version, not the dataflow itself. As a result, a dataflow can use multiple block library versions across different versions of the dataflow.

ClickYes, delete.

The specified block is deleted from the version.

Note: If you delete a block from a block library version that a dataflow uses and then try to update the dataflow to a new library version where the block no longer exists, Neo triggers a validation error. To fix this, you must remove the outdated block from the dataflow before switching to the new block library version.

# Block Library Approval Workflow

The approval workflow for block library versions ensures that changes are reviewed and validated before deploying. The block library versions progress through different statuses, allowing you to create, submit, and refine block configurations.

Below are the key statuses in the workflow:

- Draft:The initial state where you can edit and update block configurations.

- Awaiting Approval:You can submit the version for approval once the changes are complete.

- Published:After a Neo Admin approves the version, it becomes available for use in dataflows.

- Rejected:If the version is rejected, you can edit the Block Library version and revert its status toDraftfor further modifications.

# Using Block Libraries in a Dataflow

1. Attach a Library Version: To use blocks from a block library in a dataflow, attach an approved library version to the specific dataflow version you are working on. You can attach either a global or an oraganization specific library. This attachment happens at the dataflow version level, ensuring that all blocks within that dataflow version consistently use the same library version.

2. Import Blocks: Once a library version is attached, you can import any block from that library onto your dataflow canvas usingImport from Libraryfrom the block option.

3. Modify Block:  You can make modifications and override the Input Execution Logic, Cacheable feature, and Execution Path in the block imported from the library.
