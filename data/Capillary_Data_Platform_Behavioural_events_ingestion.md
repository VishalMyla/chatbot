This template is designed to support the ingestion of one type of behavioural event at a time via a data flow. You need to create a separate data flow for each event.

To configure the template, perform the following:

1. In theConnect-to-sourceBlock, enter the FTP location where the file is present and the location for saving the processed file. For information on this block. refer to the theConnect to sourcedocumentation. The file should include the information on the behavioural event that needs to be added.

2. In theDecrypt datablock, if the files are encrypted, enter the details to decrypt the data. SeeDecrypt data.

3. In theTransform-datablock, enter the following details:From theIntouch Org, select the org for which you want to ingest the behavioural event.ClickContinueand reopen the Transform data block. The corresponding event names created in the org are fetched by the system and appear in theSelect Eventdrop-down.Select the event you want to configure and ingest from theSelect Eventdrop-down.ClickContinue.  As a result, the attribute fields are auto-populated according to the selected event.In theAttributiontab, map the fields. TheeventNameis automatically added.If required, enter a valid expression to filter the data. For more information, refer to the detailed documentation on theTransform data block.(Optional) To pass a custom event date time, map theeventDateTimeAPI field.  You can also add an older event date. If the event date time is not defined, the system considers the actual event processed time.(Optional) To define the event date time format for theeventDateTime, enable theFormat transaction datacheck box and select the date and time format from theEvent Date Formatdrop-down. This should match the entered date format.The supported formats are:yyyy-MM-dd-HH:mm:ssdd-MM-yyyy HH:mm:ssdd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ssyyyy-MM-ddMM/dd/yyyy HH:mm:ssyyyy/MM/dd HH:mm:ssdd-MM-yyyyMM/dd/yyyyyyyy-dd-MM HH:mm:ssyyyyMMdd
