Hi there,

What if your most desired outcome from your customer could be made into a habit? Habits are regular behaviors or practices embedded into our routines that are tough to stop. Today, weâ€™ll explore how Capillary uses psychology to encourage favorable habits our customers can engage in.

The most effective habit loop framework follows:

A Cue

This is what triggers or kick-starts your habitual behavior. In the context of loyalty and engagement, this could look like registering for a loyalty program, liking a product, or beginning to book a flight.

A Routine`

This is the habitual behavior we want to encourage. Based on strategic goals, this could look like purchases, repeat transactions, product reviews, and referrals.

A Reward

This is what the behaviour does for you, like making dopamine or unmaking stress. This can be done to delight and reward customer behaviour through coupons, points, cash-back, special privileges, and more.

With infinite incentive loops, Capillary takes habit-building one step further. These loops are designed to keep customers re-purchasing infinitely within these habit loops with rewards that can only be redeemable by re-enacting habits we want them to build.
