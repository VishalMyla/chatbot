# Struggling to procure customer data from IT? Do this

| Hi there,Thoroughly thought out loyalty programs fail all the time. When that happens, loyalty marketers aren't immediately thinking of collecting more data.What we do is check if there’s any available customer data we can use to make the customer experience better. When that happens we’re typically met with Ron, from IT, telling us what a tough task it is.Honestly, for good reason.Most enterprise customer data is siloed by design to be used by specific teams. Like, delivery data is only ever used by the order fulfillment team; so it makes sense that they have access to it. Granting access to sensitive delivery information to us in marketing would mean a whole bunch of extra security measures to ensure that the data remains secure.Here’s what we recommend you do to bypass those issues.1. Report to IT that you’d need sensitive customer information to create a certain kind of loyalty experience. Give them a view of impact metrics, and projections, and loop in leadership if you need to.2. Have a way of unifying the data in a way that's meaningful across the Enterprise to show value back to the Enterprise of having the data in that locationTo address the latter, we take a CDP based approach at Capillary.This means your customer data isn’t just available to a single team. Customer data from multiple online and offline sources, including engagement data, transactional data, and mobile and device data, is ingested, aggregated and resolved at a customer identity level, made available for use securely, by all teams.As Joe Doran, SVP, Capillary Technologies in the US puts it, “We never stand in between you and your data which is something a lot of our competitors can't say.”And that doesn’t mean thrusting our systems onto you.Sure, we’ll suggest you use our CDP if you don’t have one in place. But if you have pockets of data and your own CDP, and you solely need a loyalty software that integrates well with it, we do that too.There’s a solution for every loyalty problem at Capillary.And nope, we don’t say this lightly.Reply to this email to check? ;)- Helping you use your siloed customer data better,Team Capillaryunsubscribe |  |  |  | Hi there,Thoroughly thought out loyalty programs fail all the time.

| Hi there,Thoroughly thought out loyalty programs fail all the time. When that happens, loyalty marketers aren't immediately thinking of collecting more data.What we do is check if there’s any available customer data we can use to make the customer experience better. When that happens we’re typically met with Ron, from IT, telling us what a tough task it is.Honestly, for good reason.Most enterprise customer data is siloed by design to be used by specific teams. Like, delivery data is only ever used by the order fulfillment team; so it makes sense that they have access to it. Granting access to sensitive delivery information to us in marketing would mean a whole bunch of extra security measures to ensure that the data remains secure.Here’s what we recommend you do to bypass those issues.1. Report to IT that you’d need sensitive customer information to create a certain kind of loyalty experience. Give them a view of impact metrics, and projections, and loop in leadership if you need to.2. Have a way of unifying the data in a way that's meaningful across the Enterprise to show value back to the Enterprise of having the data in that locationTo address the latter, we take a CDP based approach at Capillary.This means your customer data isn’t just available to a single team. Customer data from multiple online and offline sources, including engagement data, transactional data, and mobile and device data, is ingested, aggregated and resolved at a customer identity level, made available for use securely, by all teams.As Joe Doran, SVP, Capillary Technologies in the US puts it, “We never stand in between you and your data which is something a lot of our competitors can't say.”And that doesn’t mean thrusting our systems onto you.Sure, we’ll suggest you use our CDP if you don’t have one in place. But if you have pockets of data and your own CDP, and you solely need a loyalty software that integrates well with it, we do that too.There’s a solution for every loyalty problem at Capillary.And nope, we don’t say this lightly.Reply to this email to check? ;) | Hi there, | Thoroughly thought out loyalty programs fail all the time.
