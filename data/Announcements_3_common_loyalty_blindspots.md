# 3 common loyalty blindspots

| Hi there,We put a lot of energy into thinking through loyalty programs. If we factor in a customer's state of mind, and behavior, maybe reward them at the right time, they’ll stay loyal to us. We won’t have to wring our hands every time we have to face John (no offense, John) from finance.Still, heavily strategized loyalty programs go to bust every day. It isn’t because they had the wrong information or terrible execution. It's because, 9 times out of 10, theyassumethese three things.Have questions or comments? We’re all ears.
