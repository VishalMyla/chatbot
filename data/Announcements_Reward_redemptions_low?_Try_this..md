# Reward redemptions low? Try this.

| Hi there,The success of your rewards program hinges on one thing–how often your customers visit your website and redeem offers. And most brands fail to get enough visitors owing to:- The rewards aren’t what your customers are expecting- Your customers are unaware of your rewards- The redemption experience isn’t engaging1. Increase your offer rangeIf you’re still giving away rewards like points or coupons, good luck having your customers come repeatedly to you.

| Hi there, |

| The success of your rewards program hinges on one thing–how often your customers visit your website and redeem offers. And most brands fail to get enough visitors owing to: |

| - The rewards aren’t what your customers are expecting- Your customers are unaware of your rewards- The redemption experience isn’t engaging |

|  |

| 1. Increase your offer range |

| If you’re still giving away rewards like points or coupons, good luck having your customers come repeatedly to you. Your customers expect personalized offers and incentives that match their lifestyle. So, increase your offer range, and partner with multiple reward partners across categories. It’s one of the few ways to guarantee your customers coming back to you. |

| Rewards+ has a marketplace of over 7000+ offers from local and global brands, and offer categories including discounts, cashback, CLOs, and lifestyle, minus the hassles of partnering with multiple merchants. Besides, the built-in personalization engine pushes offer recommendations based on customer preferences. This means, your customers will find an offer they like at any given time. |

| 2. Send offer communications to customers |

| How many times do you send reward communications to your customers? Our hunch–not enough times. It’s simple math–if your customers are unaware of the incentives they’ve received, they’ll never be redeeming them. So send those reward communications and send a bunch of them across platforms. |

| Capillary allows you to automate sending Rewards+ communications to your customers through Engage+. Just create a draft of the reward communication you want to send on every channel on the Journeys module of Engage+ and set the entry trigger as the customer earning a reward. Now, whenever your customers earn a reward, they will get timed reminder communications to redeem the reward. This means better redemptions, and by extension, deeper loyalty. |
