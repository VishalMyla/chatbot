# Use cases

- You can use different combinations to search for events. For example, suppose you want to find an event named "Offerscan" performed by a particular user. In that case, you can filter the event search using the eventName parameter and by providing the identifier type and value of the customer.

- Similarly, to retrieve details of a particular event between certain dates, you can definefromDate,tillDate,eventNameand filter the events.`https://eu.api.capillarytech.com/v2/events/search?fromDate=2024-03-19T15:31:28&tillDate=2024-04-19T16:31:28

- Searching for an event using behavioural event attribute - For example, as a hotel chain brand, if you want to search for reservation events of a particular hotel, you can search by defining the attribute name and value. If the behavioural event attribute name ishotel_nameand the hotel name isPalaceABC, you can search using the attribute namehotel_nameand the valuePalaceABC.https://eu.api.capillarytech.com/v2/events/search?fromDate=2024-03-19T15:31:28&tillDate=2024-04-19T16:31:28&hotel_name=PalaceABC
