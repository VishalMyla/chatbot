| Hi there, |

| ‘Tis the season for building emotional loyalty with customers. Every loyalty provider is talking about it, every future loyalty report certainly is. Moreover, businesses paying attention to customers’ emotional loyalty are seeing better sales and greater NPS. One study showed that up to 59% of emotional attachment-related aspects of a customer experience drive value for businesses. |

| Building emotional loyalty with customers is more important now than ever. So, how do you do it? |

|  |

| 1. Create a cohesive omnichannel experience |

| Meeting your customers on whichever channel they are in 2024 is not enough. To form an emotional connection, brands must create a connected customer experience across channels. |

| Capillary helps brands create cohesive customer experiences through multi-touch campaigns across channels through Journeys. Marketers can deploy a journey for any customer segment, and the module automatically nudges customers to perform preferred purchase behaviors through cohesive, omnichannel brand interactions. |

| 2. Personalize customer communication at scale |

| Customers don’t just expect cohesive brand experiences, they also demand personalized content. About 87% of middle-aged customers were more likely to make a purchase after being targeted with personalized content. |

| Capillary makes message personalization at scale easy with Aira. Marketers no longer need to spend time writing personalized message templates for every event. They can simply enter a prompt to create marketing messages and Capillary’s intelligent AI bot takes care of the rest. |
