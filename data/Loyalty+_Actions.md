# Actions

Here's a look at all the actions available in Workflows:

## Award Points to Referee

A referrer is an actor who refers other customers to transact with the brand. A referee is an actor referred by a referrer. Brands can configure to incentivize either a referee or referrer or both.To award points to the referee, you need to have points earned condition, points expiry condition (if required), and channels through which you want to communicate or notify the customers when points are awarded.You need to configure earn condition, expiry condition, and channels through which you want to communicate on the points earned by the referee.

### Earn condition

Click on theEarn Conditiondrop-down to choose the desired points earning condition for the referee.To create a new earning condition and use it:

1. Click+ Add condition.

![510](https://files.readme.io/a9019c4-2HJ1Cg8_sayOAYk1aN7nX_qt-RVtGShT3A.png)

1. InName, enter a relevant condition name.

2. InDescription, enter a short description of the condition.

3. InModule using this condition, choose the module where you want to use the condition. In this case, it is Loyalty+.

4. InAllocate based on, choose on what basis points need to be allocated.

- Loyalty Registration: To issue points when the referee registers. This should be based on the configuration settings for the referral program.

- Loyalty Transaction: To issue points when the referee makes a transaction.

1. InAllocation type, choose whether to issue fixed points or prorated points.

- Fixed: A fixed number of points will be allocated irrespective of the transaction amount.

- Prorated: Points are issued as a percentage of the transaction amount or custom field value.

1. To have a common allocation to all tiers, check theSame for all Tiers.To allocate points differently for each tier, uncheck Same for all tiers. You will see an option to configure for each tier. Set your preferred values for each tier based on theAllocation typechosen.

![416](https://files.readme.io/49ee456-gi4uMb251xFMHvjFtEmBlOp5gI_xaObQOg.png)

1. SetEnable delayed accrualto green to allocate points to the current account after a certain period. This is usually the transaction return period that is configured for the org. So, customer can redeem points only if the transaction is not returned. Use this especially in cases where transaction return is allowed.

![454](https://files.readme.io/099343d-XFCQNNSUjdLqeKc7D3c5vn4X5bRu3EwbHQ.png)

1. EnableSame for all Tiersand the condition becomes relevant for all tiers. If disabled, you have to configure conditions for each tier. For more information, see here.

2. ClickDoneto save the condition.

### Configure communication channel(s)

Once you set the points earning and expiry conditions, it is important to communicate the points earned by the referee.Loyalty+ supports two different configurations for communications.

### Mandatory channels

Here you can select the channels through which the communication has to be sent out for sure. Then, configure the message for each channel you select.

![1350](https://files.readme.io/a9fb95a-MandatoryChannels.png)

### Priority channels

Here, you can set the channels through which the communication needs to be sent out based on the priority and availability. For example, if you set the priority in the order SMS, email, and mobile push, the system will first check if the customer's mobile number is available,

- If available, it will send an SMS communication and ignores the rest.

Finally, configure the message for each communication channel you have chosen.

For more information on communication channels, see here.

## Forward to Set

The general expressions that you define at the parent set level allow you to evaluate conditions at the transaction level. However, you need to use Forward to set to evaluate line-items, payment mode, or tracker values of the transaction. When you use Forward to set on a condition, it creates a subset where you can define rules on the transaction items.

You can either use line-item unrolling or payment method unrolling, or both of them in a single action.

The following are the options available for the Forward to set action.

![313](https://files.readme.io/ad36405-LDaxbpQ7QHB2TRoU8NrcMjptr-iDoj8IhA.png)

## Evaluate rules at the line-item level (Enable line-item unrolling)

Enable the toggle button to evaluate rules on transaction line items. When enabled, L+ evaluates the defined rules for every line item of the transaction.

You will see the options shown in the following image.

![316](https://files.readme.io/a93fb85-tog_VIK2U16ig9kWjteXVTznONNU1ybgdA.png)

- Use line item proportions: Enable this option when line item amounts may not add up to the transaction amount. Enable this when there is a bill-level discount that you want to distribute to the line items of the transaction.

- Maximise points allocation: Enable this option to maximize points for the eligible payment methods - payment methods marked as eligible under Advanced Settings.

Points are allocated for the total eligible amount rather than on a prorated basis. Individual line item amounts are not considered when this option is enabled.

## Evaluate payment modes (Enable payment method unrolling)

This option lets you run rules on individual payment methods. When you on Enable payment method unrolling, the rules defined in the forwarded set would be evaluated multiple times - it repeats for every payment method in the transaction.

1. SelectDelay strategy: Following are the different delayed-accrual (or point conversion strategies) that are currently available for the brands to use.

As defined in the allocation strategy:Points are assigned based on the conditions defined in the allocation strategy. If no conditions are defined, points will be directly issued as current points.

Fixed delay days from item return period:Based on the return period configured against the product, issue the promised points as current points once the return period expires. For example, assume for a transaction with a return period of 7 days, the customer is promised to get 1000 points. These promised points will be converted into current points after 7 days i.e. after the return period is over.

- Available only for transaction-based customer activities.

Fixed delay days from the line-item extended field:Based on the value of the line-item extended field that is selected in the drop-down. Say, there is a line-item extended field called "ABC" & this is selected in the drop-down of "delay strategy" during the point allocation action after selecting this delay strategy. Now, say a user made a transaction & the value of this field is arrived as 10. Then the points that are being allocated from that action will have a delayed accrual of 10 days.

- Available only for transaction-based customer activities, and the line-item extended field should mandatorily come from the transaction payload.

On external trigger:Issue points at the event of ‚Äútransaction add‚Äù as promised points and convert them at the event of ‚Äútransaction update‚Äù. For example: In hospitals, promised points will be issued immediately when you make a booking and will be converted into current points when the bill is settled.

- Available only for transaction-based customer activities.

Based on the behavioral event attribute: Based on the date that is coming via the attribute of the behavioral event. Assume, there is a behavioral "ABC" that has 3 attributes (X, a date type attribute; Y, a customer identifier attribute; Z, a numerical attribute). During the point allocation from a promotion (that is created based on this behavioral event), if the delay strategy is selected as "Based on the event attribute", then there will be a drop-down where the attribute should be selected. The following are vital points:

- In the drop-down of "delay strategy", only the date type of the attribute of the behavioral event will appear.

- Under the prorate drop-down, only the double-type attributes of the behavioral event will appear.

- If the date coming is a past date as per the event processing date, the conversion will happen on the same day.

- This option will be available only for promotions based on behavioral events.

Following are the accrual strategies available for transaction-based activities:

## Customer status & label

This action lets you configure the "customer status & label" for your customers directly from the workflows. This action will be available in both the loyalty programs & loyalty promotions.

For example:

1. If you want to change the "label" of all the customers who made transactions worth more than 10,000 as "high-value", it can be done with this action directly from workflows.

2. If you want to change the "label" of all the customers who made more than 5 returns to "suspecting", it can be simply done with this action.

To use this action, do the following steps. Go to workflow -> action, and there you'll find:

An action "change customer status & label"

![](https://files.readme.io/d248215-Screenshot_2024-01-08_at_5.40.36_PM.png)

Now select the status & label you want to configure. Note that, the label is unique across status. This means that, when you are selecting the label, you are selecting the status also.

![](https://files.readme.io/80afd2b-Screenshot_2024-01-08_at_5.40.52_PM.png)

You'll find that configured action in the display once it is done.
