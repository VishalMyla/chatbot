# Your guide to overcoming the next customer data crisis ⚠️

| Heard of the idiom “ignorance opens the doors to doom”?Even if you haven’t, chances are, you understand the sentiment all too well.This is perhaps why you have a steady stream of customer data to make crucial decisions, essentially shielding your company from the winds of changing customer expectations.But what happens when the data transmission stops?Usually, one of two things.1. Businesses create new models to predict customer behavior2. Companies develop 360-degree customer behavioral profilesThe first approach, one that’s being increasingly talked about in marketing circles, is creating digital twins of customers.This entails creating adigital copyof the physical entity (in our case, a customer) with enough data such that it mimics the real world. Now one can simulate conditions and navigate how the virtual customer alters their behavior and interactions to effectively alter their customer-facing approaches, without burning excess time or money. The catch?The technology isn’t there yet. Plus, such a system needs a lot of analysis and maintenance.This brings us to approach number two, which we deem to be the more effective way of solving the customer data problem – building a 360-degree customer profile. Counter intuitive? We think not.Now, we’ll be the first ones to admit that achieving a 360-degree view of your buyers is no child’s play. After all, only 14% of companies have achieved this feat as per research.That’s where a tool like Insights+ comes in.With it, you can:1. Collect and integrate data from various first-party sources, at scale 🤌🏽That includes collating data from offline stores, socials, online stores, and integrating them to create a near-accurate profile of your customer. Not just that. Capillary makes retrieving and using the data extremely easy with its cloud integration abilities.2. Get deeper insights into customer behavior trends 📈Use AI-based propensity models in Insights+ to not only predict buyer behavior based on past interactions, but increase the accuracy through loyalty stage filters, purchase pattern filters, and many more. Use these insights to give prescriptive recommendations to your customer-facing teams.3. Create compelling visualizations quickly 📊Ensure your customer insights translate to business decisions by converting them into compelling visualizations for business users. Use visual cues to help leaders instantly discover ideas, gaps, and opportunities through your insights analyses. And do much, much more.Psst.
