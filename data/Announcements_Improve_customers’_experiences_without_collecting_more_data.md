# Improve customers’ experiences without collecting more data

| Hi there,Looks like the US is facing its worst customer experience crisis yet. We recently readForrester’s 2024 US Customer Experience Reportand learned that the average effectiveness of experiences fell to 64%. There is a knee-jerk response to this, and it’s often “Collect MORE data.” But the volume of data often isn’t even the problem.We’re sitting on a goldmine of data without ever being able to use it to its potential. And that’s due to one of two reasons:-Fragmented data collection-Inefficient data usageThe solution is a simple one–ensure your customer data gets collated, analyzed, and used effectively. Here’s how.1. Create a single source of customer information 👩🏽‍💻Any customer data that enters your systems should be collected, cleaned, cataloged, and updated, for it to be useful to you. Many companies rely heavily on their data teams, third-party providers, and disparate tools to achieve this. But you can leave that to us.With Capillary, you access a 360-degree understanding of your customers through Member Care. Data from customer interactions, third parties, and your physical stores get automatically cleaned, consolidated, and updated in real time by our system. This means top-notch data whenever, even for those last-minute campaigns.2. Analyze your customer data 📊If you aren’t analyzing your customer data yet, you’re only ever using it to deliver broad-segment, generic, customer campaigns like a festival or a seasonal one. In contrast, when you analyze your data in ‘n’ number of ways,(and understand it well)you not only discover novel insights about your campaigns but find new ways to personalize them.Our Insights+ platform allows you to slice the results of your campaign in multiple ways, including various KPIs, and their attributes like the latest event date, report start date, and more to effectively analyze them. Besides that, you get the option of presenting your data in multiple digestible formats like pivot tables, migration charts, funnel charts, and more.3. Leverage AI to execute contextual campaigns 🤖Analyzing past customer behaviors will help you create retrospective campaigns. But you unlock a bunch of opportunities when you use AI to predict future customer behaviors–like running real-time behavior-triggered campaigns too.Capillary’s Insights+ comes built-in with AI-propensity models that help analyze past customer behavior patterns and predict their future behaviors across dimensions like lapsation, CLTV, channel, product, and more. The best part? You get prescriptive recommendations for the next best step, meaning you’re never spending too much time in analysis paralysis and instead executing quickly.Have any questions regarding setup, capabilities, or pricing?

Here’s how. | 1. Create a single source of customer information 👩🏽‍💻 | Any customer data that enters your systems should be collected, cleaned, cataloged, and updated, for it to be useful to you. Many companies rely heavily on their data teams, third-party providers, and disparate tools to achieve this.

Analyze your customer data 📊 | If you aren’t analyzing your customer data yet, you’re only ever using it to deliver broad-segment, generic, customer campaigns like a festival or a seasonal one.
