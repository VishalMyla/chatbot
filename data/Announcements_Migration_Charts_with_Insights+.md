Get insights on tier migration: Retention marketers love it!

“Consumers who engage with high-performing loyalty programs are 78% more likely to spend a premium”

The most fundamental loyalty strategy is that of tiers. The more customers move up your tiers, the likelier they are to stay engaged, invest in your relationship, and stay loyal.

Your goal as a marketing manager is to ensure your tier strategy remains relevant and rewarding for your unique set of customers. With well-crafted tiers, you can drive layers of gratification for your customers that keep them hooked.

With Capillary, you can instantly set up a Migration Chart that helps track the migration of users from one tier to another.

Interpreting migration charts

A migration chart helps track the migration of users from one tier to another. This could be tier upgrades or downgrades. We’re looking into 3 cases of tier migration.

Upwards migration in lower tiers

- Upwards migration in lower tiers

At the starting tiers, you would want to keep your audience more engaged and see a move up the tiers.📈 Seeing a low migration from lower to higher tiers could be a potential indicator that there’s resistance in your audience to move up the tiers. It can be an intentional strategy - particularly with ‘elite’ brands. However, if that isn’t an active strategy, it’s a sign you should make it more attainable.

Downwards migration

- Downwards migration

No matter what the tier, a downgrade is an indicator of something not working in an ideal case. There could be multiple causes for this: You might want to look at:🚀 Engage across the customer lifecycle with customer journeys✅ Improving quality & personalization of engagement📊 Improve offers & promotions - in personalization or in value
