Limitations of the customer identifier update API:

- Only identifiers can be updated using this API

- Identifiers should be unique within a source for single account sources and unique within an account for multiple account sources.

- If an identifier that you add already exists in a different source/account, the account will be automatically merged into the existing account maintaining different entries of each source. The new account will be a victim account and the existing account is a survivor account.

### Prerequisites

- Valid customer identifier(s) that you want to add to the existing account

> ðŸ“˜The new identifier that you want to update should be unique across the source (for sources with single accounts) and unique across the account (for sources with multiple accounts).
