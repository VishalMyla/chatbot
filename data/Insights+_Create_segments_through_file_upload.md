# Create segments through file upload

There are two ways of uploading a file -

1. Upload a file directly,

2. Upload the file through an FTP server.

The segments created through upload are static as the customers/values in a partition do not change automatically. However, you can edit a segment to update details manually, i.e., you can add new customers or update existing segment values  (partition name) of customers.

Your CSV file should have the following headers:

1st column header: user_id, mobile, email or external_id2nd column header: value

You can also track customer activities manually by making the respective segment SCD and specifying the date of the tracked values every time you update the segment.

| OPTION | DESCRIPTION |

| --- | --- |

| Valid from | You need to manually specify the date when the events specified in the CSV file have happened (for SCD). Hence, whenever you upload a new file, it is required to specify the date on which the values are tracked |

| Upload Type - Upload | SelectUploadto directly upload the CSV file and click Choose File to upload the filSample contents of a .csv file with customer id and loyalty value: mobile,value44700900000,High 44700915020,Low44700911011,High |

| Upload Type - FTP | SelectFTPto upload through an FTP server >specify the path in the FTP server where the file is available and > clickUploadNote:Enter a valid FTP path. FTP path must be relative to the configured root folder. For example, rootfolder/FTP path such as ftp://demo_apac/demo_master/demo_path/demo**points.csv. Here, demo_apac/demo_master/ is the root folder and /demo_path/ is the FTP path.To use FTP, you should have configured the FTP  address and access credentials as explained below1. Navigate toSegments>Settings.2. SpecifyServer Address(FTP server URL),Username, andPassword.Notes:1. The file name should adhere to the following format: "_segment name__suffix**"For instance, take 'demo__points.csv' as an example. Here, 'demo' represents the segment name, separated by a double underscore from the 'points' suffix.2. The FTP path must point to the correct CSV file.3. The first row of the CSV sheet must be a column header.4. The first column header must be a user identifier such as user id, mobile, email, and external_ID.If the identifier is mobile(mobile number), country code is mandatory (without the "+" sign). For example, 919972752991.5. The second column header must have a partition value. For example, If the first column header is the user_id(1,2,3, and so on) then the second column header must hold the partition value( high, medium, or low). |



1. ClickUpload & Proceed. You will see the segment with the list of partitions as shown below

- Partitions: Partitions are different values of a segment. For example, if a segment has high loyal, low loyal, and medium loyal as segment values, then three partitions will be created (one for each value)
