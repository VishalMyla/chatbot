# Data export

Data Export helps you export the CRM data available in Capillary's system to an SFTP location or internal server. You can export data related to customers, transactions, coupons, points, Footfall, and campaigns.

You can create an export job using (predefined) standard templates or custom templates. Each template is a combination of either KPIs or facts, and dimensions.

## Limitations

- Supports a maximum of one year's data. The maximum size of the file which can be exported is 20GB. If the exported file exceeds this limit, a validation error is triggered.

- Always works on Incremental Data Set. An incremental data set refers to a subset of data that has been updated or modified since the last export or processing operation. Instead of exporting or processing the entire data set each time, only the changes or additions made since the last operation are considered. This approach helps in optimizing resource usage and improving efficiency, especially when dealing with large volumes of data.

- Unable to edit a template once created

- Unable to modify KPIs, dimensions, filters, and customer list once scheduled

- Unable to export measures (such as bill id, bill number, bill amount, auto update time) and custom fields in custom templates. You can export only KPIs and its dimensions

- Limit of selecting only five dimensions in a custom template for an export job

- Current day's data will not be included in the exported data as the data will be synced to the capillary server only during nights
