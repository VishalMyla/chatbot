After a deletion request is raised for a customer, their status changes toDeletion Pending. The member account is deleted only after the deletion request is approved.

For more information on member account deletion request configuration and request statuses, refer toPII deletion configuration.

## Merge Accounts

When duplicate accounts of a customer exist, you can merge those accounts into one. One account will be retained, and the other account will be removed.

*Surviving Account: The customer account that will continue to exist after the accounts are merged is referred to as the Surviving Account.Deactivating Account / Victim account: The customer account that will be removed after merging is referred to as a deactivating account. Once deactivated, this account cannot be reactivated, and its data cannot be retrieved. Except for Behavioural events and requests, all other data is transferred to the survivor account.
