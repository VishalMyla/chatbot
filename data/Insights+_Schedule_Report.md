# Schedule Report

The Schedule Report function allows you to automate report scheduling, offering options such as daily, weekly, monthly, or fixed times. Once scheduled, the system automatically sends these reports via email to designated recipients. Each email includes scorecards displaying all Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) from the report, along with the option to download the report as an Excel file and a direct link to view it on Insights+.
