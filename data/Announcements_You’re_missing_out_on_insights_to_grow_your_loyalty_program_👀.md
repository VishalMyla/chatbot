A better solution may allow you to create custom reportsâ€“even visualize results in many different ways. But the onus of putting the data from these reports to good use, rests on you, the loyalty marketer. And thatâ€™s a hard job when youâ€™re managing a bunch of loyalty initiatives, or worse if youâ€™ve newly been assigned to lead your companyâ€™s loyalty marketing.What if your reporting dashboardactuallyhelped you make better loyalty marketing decisions?As Jim Sturm, SVP, Capillary, USA, puts it, loyalty marketers need four kinds of insights to make better marketing decisions.1.
