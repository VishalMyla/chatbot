| Issue | Resolution |

| --- | --- |

| File size is getting reduced | Expected behavior. File size reduction due to image transformations does not affect user experience. Specify image dimensions to maintain quality.For example, if the email specifies a height and width of 200 x 300, images are transformed to match these dimensions instead of saving the original image, which might have very high dimensions. Consequently, the file size is reduced. This reduction could also occur due to dynamic image quality adjustments based on file sizes. |

| Image getting compressed excessively | Compression varies with file size. Smaller images have less compression; larger images undergo higher compression. This makes sure that irrespective of the file size, similar quality of images is achieved after compression. Do not artificially enlarge images to increase the file size. |

| Images saved in avif format instead of jpeg | Images are saved in their actual format except when the device supports avif format. avif format enables saving the images in smaller file sizes without impacting image quality. |
