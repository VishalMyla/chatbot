# Authorization

Authorization ensures that authenticated users with the right permissions can use specific APIs or resources. For example, you can configure authorization settings to limit a user to making only "GET Customer Detail" API requests (for reading information) without the ability to add new customers.

Authorization in Capillary APIs is achieved using the Access control feature.

# Access group

An access group is a set ofData APIandConfig APIresourceswith defined permissions.

You can use these access groups and can set API endpoint access restrictions for stores. For example, an access group Instore with only Write (POST) access toCustomerresources.

By default,Built-in access group(created by Capillary) are available and can be used for common integrations such as POS, Instore, and Admin. If required, you can also create aCustom  access group.

> ðŸ“˜NoteFor the existing integrations, access group is provided based on the existing usage analysis. You can create a custom group, if additional accesses are required.

## ðŸ“˜Note

Note

For the existing integrations, access group is provided based on the existing usage analysis. You can create a custom group, if additional accesses are required.

## Resources

A Resource includes a set of APIs. For example, a Card resource includes all APIs related to the Card entity. Similarly, a resource named Customer can include all APIs related to the Customer entity.

3. (Optional) In theGroup descriptiontextbox, enter a brief description of the access group.

4. In theGroup permission, select the  and set the permission forData APIandConfig APIas follows:None: No access to any of the API endpoints associated with the resource.Read: Access to GET API endpoints associated with the resource. For example, an access group with Read access to Coupon resources will have access to all Coupon GET API endpoints.Write: Access to POST API endpoints. For example, an access group with Write access to Coupon resource will have access to all Coupon POST API endpoints.For information on Resource, Data API, and Config API, seeGroup permission.You can also search with a resource name or an endpoint name and find the required API resource or endpoint. SeeSearch resource and endpoint.

- None: No access to any of the API endpoints associated with the resource.

- Read: Access to GET API endpoints associated with the resource. For example, an access group with Read access to Coupon resources will have access to all Coupon GET API endpoints.

- Write: Access to POST API endpoints. For example, an access group with Write access to Coupon resource will have access to all Coupon POST API endpoints.For information on Resource, Data API, and Config API, seeGroup permission.You can also search with a resource name or an endpoint name and find the required API resource or endpoint.

8. ClickSave.

9. ClickAllocate storeand from the store page, allocate the access group to the store. SeeAllocate store.

## Group permission

The group permission allows you to set access restrictions to the API resources. The group permission section includes the following details:

- Data API: API endpoints associated with generic data. For example, customer data, basic coupon information, company data, etc.

- Config API: API endpoints that are not related to generic data and are associated with any type of configuration. For example, coupon series, templates, communication templates, etc.

- Resources: A group of logically grouped API endpoints that are used for a common purpose. You can click on the info icon in the Data API and Config PI to see the list of API endpoints in the particular resource.ðŸ“˜All endpoints are not mapped to the exact entity it belongs to. Endpoints are grouped based on the logical reasons. For example, Organization resource includes endpoints from audit entity.Search resources and endpointYou can enter the resource name and find the desired resource. You can also enter the desired API endpoint and find the related resource.

# Default access group

The default access group defines the default access group for all the stores under an organisation and is also called an org-level access group.  A default access group is used in the below scenarios:

- Allstoresinherit the default access group from the org. If required, you can edit and change the access group of a particular store. For information on setting an access group to the store, seeAllocate store.

- ðŸ“˜All tills inherit the access group of the store. If you move a till from one store to another, the access group of the new store is inherited.When you change a default access group, API access of all stores that use the default access group changes as per the new default access group.

- During data import. You need to set the default access group before you import multiple stores. For more information, seeData import.

#### Set default access group

To set the default access group

1. In theDefault access groupclickEdit

# Allocate store

If you want to change the default access store of a store, you can allocate a store and set desired access group for a store. You can allocate the access group for bothCustom  access groupandBuilt-in access group.

To allocate,

1. On the access group, clickAllocate Store.The respective store page appears.

2. Click on the desired store and clickEdit.

3. From theAccess Groupdrop-down, select the access group.

# FAQs

1. What is the advantage of setting access group permissions?Setting access group permissions improve API security and avoid unauthorized access. At present, if transaction access is granted for a till it has access to many APIs that are not required for the till. With access group permission configuration, access to unwanted APIs is avoided. The APIs required for integration are identified by behaviour study and are grouped accordingly.

2. Is a default access group mandatory for integrations?It is recommended to have a default access group as it helps the stores under the organisation to inherit the access group of the organisation.

3. Will this impact existing OAuth-based authentication?No. Access groups are created based on the usage of APIs by the organisations and are provided access accordingly. You can also add the required access group to your store if you need any additional access.

4. Can you deactivate an access group?You can deactivate an  (<>) not linked to any stores. <> cannot be deactivated.

5. Can you override the default access group at the till level?No. All tills added under a store inherit the storeâ€™s access group. This cannot be overridden.

6. What is the difference between a built-in access group and a custom access group?Built-in access groups are predefined access groups created by capillary that can be used for common integrations. You can create custom access groups if the built-in access groups do not meet your requirements.

7. How can you differentiate between a built-in access group and a custom access group?In the **Created by** column name Capillary appears for built-in access groups whereas, for custom access groups, the name of the respective person/brand appears.
