Hi there,

A Gartner study recently stated that good customer experience accounts for 2/3rds of their purchase decision. Now, there’s a lot that goes into building a delightful customer experience – you need to be at the right place, at the right time, saying all the right things based on your customer’s preferences. At Capillary, we always strive to help brands maximize value with our products so they can achieve new heights in their Loyalty and Engagement.

In this week’s newsletter, we will share how one of our customers, a leading Food Brand successfully configured and built out a strategy that was able to achieve this great feat.

We got to chat with the Chief Digital Officer and VP at the brand, to walk us through how him and his team upped their loyalty game.

Let’s dive in!

Keep track of your segment performance 🔎

The brand had already set up various segments, but upon analysis found that only their top 2 segments were showing conversions. This motivated them to deep dive into how they were creating these segments and how they can improve them.

Leverage AI and Machine Learning ⚙️

The brand immediately leaned on Capillary’s AI-powered machine learning tools to analyze user behavior. They also used this analysis to build behavioral segments and set up propensity models to evaluate the most effective communication methods, and who is most likely to make the purchase.

Fuel your funnels 💪

When it comes to the channels you use to reach your customers, you need to make sure that they are: Conversational.
A successful omni-channel campaign will interact with their customers where they are most responsive, and likely to make a purchase from.

Add some gamification to the mix! 🎮

For customers today, value isn’t perceived, it is earned. Gamification in Loyalty campaigns incorporates this effectively as customers not only enjoy games, but also feel a sense of achievement when they’ve earned their rewards through the medium. Not to mention, your campaigns immediately stand out!

The brand leveraged our AI capabilities to refine their segments, identify the best mediums to converse in, and added gamification through QR codes in their campaigns, that customers could engage with and win exciting prizes like an iPhone 12, and E-vouchers upto 20K.

To sum it up, there is no one right way to capture the best results for your campaigns. Bringing out innovation and creativity in your campaigns will require you to constantly improvise, adapt and overcome – and that’s exactly what Capillary is here to help you do!

Helping you learn from the best,

Team Capillary
