# Points

You can define conditions for earning points, redeeming points, expiry of points and returning points.

## Overview

Earn conditions allow an org to create various conditions and define how a customer can earn points. You can have common points allocation across tiers or different allocations for each tier.

> ðŸ“˜ForMLP enabled orgs, allocation strategies created in a program are associated only with that program and cannot be used even in the org's default program.

## ðŸ“˜

ForMLP enabled orgs, allocation strategies created in a program are associated only with that program and cannot be used even in the org's default program.

### Configure Points Delayed Accrual

Delayed accrual allows issuing points to customer for an activity at a later date. For example, if you support item returns, say for a week from the purchase date, you can actually block customers from using those points before the return period. This avoids redundancy and fraud activities.

In Delayed Accrual, points are first issued as promised points. These cannot be redeemed by the customer. After the configured period, these points are converted and credited to the main balance.

In Delayed Accrual, the points allocation date is when points are actually issued to the customer. In the case of Delayed Accrual, the awarded date is when points get added to the current points (accrued date). Refer to the following examples for clarity.

- If a transaction with bill date A is sent to Loyalty EMF on date B, the awarded date is date B.

- If the transactionAdd activity of date A gets replayed on date B, the awarded date is date B.

- If bill points with bill date A are imported on date B, the awarded date is date B.

> ðŸ“˜The 'delayed accrual points' are added to the 'current points' on the next morning of the delay period, i.e., (event date + the number of days of delay) specified in the point allocation strategy.If a transaction is added on 28th Sep and the number of days of delay is 1, the delayed accrual points will get added to current points on the morning of 30th Sep (morning after 28, Sep + 1 day). The awarded date is 30 Sep.You can create rules on the points that are redeemable, non-redeemable, or with the summation of both.

## Points unlock ability

By now, it is very clear that brands can give delayed points to their customers from our Loyalty settings (delayed accrual strategy). However, some times brands might want to convert these delayed points also as redeemable points for their customers.

The only way available to do this is via external triggers. Till now, we have this ability only for bill level. But now, we have the ability to do this even on line item levels.

Some sample use cases:

1. As a system integrator, I would like to be able to to configure fixed return windows for different line items, allocate promised points on each line item and convert them to redeemable points according to each line itemâ€™s return window, so that the users can get regular points on each line item, as and when the return window for the line items gets over and don't have to wait for the default return windows to get over.

2. As a Loyalty Program Manager, I would like to be able to give my customer an option to end the return window for any transaction or any line item in the transaction and immediately convert promised points to regular points.

You can find more information on how to use this API at below link, please refer.

Points Unlock API

## Configure points earn conditions

There are two allocation types available.

- Fixed: A fixed number of points is allocated irrespective of the transaction amount.

- Prorated: Points are issued as a percentage of the transaction amount or custom field value and through step function.

Based on the chosen allocation type, you can have the following combinations of points allocation strategies.

- Reward points as a percentage of a transaction amount with the same percentage across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15%, Tier2: 15%.

- Reward points as a percentage of the transaction amount with different percentages for each tier. For example - Tier1: 15% of the transaction amount, Tier2: 20% of the transaction amount.

- Reward a fixed number of points per transaction across tiers. For example - Tier1: 15 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.

- Reward a fixed number of points per transaction with different values across tiers. For example - Tier1: 10 points per transaction, Tier2: 15 points per transaction.To configure earning conditions, do the following.

- Reward a fixed number of points in equal step sizes or transaction intervals. For example, allocate 10 points on every spend of Rs.200. So a person doing a transaction of 450 will get 20 points, because his transaction amount lies between 400 - 600.

| Option | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Tiers | This is the default option. Points are allocated to customers according to their tiers. |

| Loyalty Registration | Points are allocated to customers based on the information they provide during the registration. You can select any one of the custom fields.For example, if you select an age group of 25-30, points are allocated to customers belonging to this exact age group. |

| Loyalty Transaction | Points are allocated to customers on the basis of their Loyalty transaction. For example, if you select order_channel, points are awarded only to customers who made a transaction through a particular channel(For example- Instore). |



![280](https://files.readme.io/039be42-dymtQnUNnm_CG4qK_1hg6TLrUNBIF4SvYA.png)

1. InAllocation Type, select your preferred allocation type to define the criteria for giving points to customers.

| Option | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Fixed | To reward a fixed number of points (irrespective of the transaction amount).For example - 10 to issue 10 points per transaction. |

| Prorated- in terms of % | To reward points as a percentage of the transaction amount.For example - 10 to issue points of 50 points if the transaction amount is 500. |

| Points Multiplier- in terms of % | To reward extra points to the customer along with existing points. For example, 5x of the current points allocation strategy.  This is used in promotions (run for a shorter period) along with an existing allocation strategy.For example, if an org issues 10 points to customers in the lowest tier, during Diwali season the org can issue 10X points to attract customers in the lowest tier to make more purchases with the org. The customer will receive 100 points (10 multiplied by 10) if they make a transaction with org during the Diwali season. |

| Prorate - In terms of step function | To reward fixed number of points for equal transaction intervals or steps. For example, allocate 6 points on every transaction of 150. So on every step of 150, allocate 6 points. This way, transaction amount lying between 151-300 get  6 points, lying between 301-450 get 12 points and so on. |

- DELAYED ACCRUAL: Points are reflected in the customer's account immediately after the transaction but are only redeemable after the prescribed number of days. For example, if an apparel store has a return policy of seven days, and a customer buys a shirt and gets 20 points on this purchase. The points are reflected in the customer's account right after the purchase, but if the customer decides to return the shirt on the third day, the points will disappear from the account and the customer is unable to use the acquired points. Delayed accrual prevents customers from misusing points.

| Option | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Event Date | Points expire on the configured date based on the last activity (transaction/registration) done by the customer. For example, if a customer buys a shirt on June 10, 2021, then the validity period for points for this customer can be set on any day after this transaction was made. |

| Rolling Expiry from Event Date | The current date of points expiry is reset to a new date based on the recent transaction date. That is, if a customer earns points before the expiry of existing points, the validity of all points will reset to the new points expiry date.For example, if a customer who made a transaction on June 10, 2021, has their point expiring on July 10, 2021, but they again made a transaction on July 7, 2021, then customersâ€™ existing points along with the newly acquired point will have a new validity period, based on the transaction made on July 7, 2021.Note: Only the points that were issued via rolling strategies are extended. |

| Membership Event Date | Points expire automatically when the membership expires. This is usually used for membership-based loyalty. For example, if a customer has subscribed to a Platinum membership with a Digital store, and has his/her membership expiring in January 2022, then the points earned by this customer also expire in January 2022. |

| Customer's registration date | Points will expire on the registration date of the customer. This registration date refers to the date on which customer got enrolled or registered into the loyalty program. This will be same for all tiers. |

| Fixed date | Points will expire on a fixed date. This fixed date will be selected here, and every year points will expire on this date. This will be same for all tiers. |

| Transaction extended field | Points expire based on the date provided by the selected transaction-extended field.This capability supports time units (days, months). The date in the selected extended field will have the specified time unit added to it, and that final date becomes the expiry date of the points.If the calculated expiry date is in the past, the system sets the expiry to 7 days from the event processing date instead of failing the event.Note:As this is a transaction-extended field where the value of the field will be coming via a transaction this is available only for the loyalty module when creating the expiry strategy. |

| Customer extended field | Points expire based on the date in the selected customer-extended field. This capability supports time units (days, months). The date in the selected extended field will have the specified time unit added to it, and that final date becomes the expiry date of the points.If the calculated expiry date is in the past, the system sets the expiry to 7 days from the event processing date instead of failing the event.Note:As this customer-extended field is independent of the transaction, it is available in both the loyalty and engage modules when creating the expiry strategy. |



Enable Same for all Tiers.In Time Unit, select your preferred option to set the validity period for points.

| Option | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Days | Points expire after the configured number of days.For example, if a customer makes a transaction on July 1, 2021, and the Days for expiry is set as 10, points will expire on July 11, 2021. |

| Months | Points expire after the configured number of months.NOTE: Points will expire only on the last day of the month,For example, if a customer makes a transaction on July 10, 2021, and Months for expiry is set as 1, points will expire on August 31, 2021. |

| Date | Points expire on the configured date.For example, if a customer makes a transaction on June 1, 2021, and the Date for expiry is set as August 10, 2021, then points will expire on this fixed date only. |

| Never | Points will never expire for the customer. |



In Expire Pts. at the end of, enter the days or number of months for points to expire.For Date, you have to select a date on which points expire. For Never, there is no configuration required.

Click Done.

### Points rounding strategy

You can define the strategy for rounding off points. Based on the number of decimals configured, the rounding is considered up to those decimal places. For example, if the round-off is set to two decimal places, the rounding would be for the nearest hundredths.

The types of strategies for rounding are as follows:

1. Ceiling: Rounds numbers towards positive infinity. Positive numbers round-up, while negative numbers round down (towards zero).

2. Floor: Rounds numbers towards negative infinity. Positive numbers round down, while negative numbers round down.

3. Round Half Up: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded up.

4. Round Half Down: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding up when the next digit is five or more.  If the decimal is 5 (midway), then it is rounded down.

5. Round Half Even: Rounds to the nearest value, rounding to the nearest even number when the next digit is exactly five.

For example, 25.8751 points are to be allocated to a customer and the round-off is set to two decimal places, The following table highlights the value of points that will be issued based on the round off strategy:

| Round Strategy | Ceiling | Floor | Half Up (Default) | Half Down | Half Even |

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Points round-up (25.8751) | 25.88 | 25.87 | 25.88 | 25.87 | 25.88 |
