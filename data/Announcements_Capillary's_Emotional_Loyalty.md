Hi there,

Creating new sales promotions or thanking your customers post-sales is awesome! More sales never hurt. But doing only this can make relationships feel transactional, pull customers out of their interest in your brand, and make them want more from the brands they love.

So how do you build an honest connection with your customers without compromising your business goals?

Beyond sales with Capillary’s Emotional Loyalty

Your customers are people. Build loyalty and relationships with your customers much like any 2 people would–through trust, relevance and attachment. Capillary’s emotional loyalty recognizes these motivational drivers and helps you build on your customer relationship with incentives at every step of the way, not just purchases.
