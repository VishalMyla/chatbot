# Coalition program

Coalition programs are loyalty programs of the Org that are created outside Capillary. Loyalty+ supports syncing tiers of partner programs and adding customers to the program. This means that two or more brands can collaborate to give incentives to customers. Here the burden of the incentive cost is divided between the brands and the customer can become loyal to all these brands simultaneously. For example, a car manufacturer and an insurance company can come together to incentivise customers to pick them together.

Some of the salient features of the coalition program are:

- Brand partnerships to increase customer touchpoints to improve engagement and recall

- Enrollment only via linking APIs

- Can sync with partner tiers based on enrollment or update triggers

- Does not expire unless a customer is delinked or unsubscribed from the partner's loyalty program

- No program expiry, generally these contracts are long-term.
