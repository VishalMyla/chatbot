# Execution of a Dataflow

After creating a dataflow, you can integrate it into applications. You can also import it to any API testing tool and execute or test it.

## Copying a Dataflow cURL

To copy the dataflow cURL,

1. Identify the Dataflow Scope:Go to theDataflowspage and select the tab based on the dataflowâ€™s scope:My Dataflowsâ†’ For dataflows within your organization.Global Dataflowsâ†’ For dataflows at the global level.

Identify the Dataflow Scope:Go to theDataflowspage and select the tab based on the dataflowâ€™s scope:

- My Dataflowsâ†’ For dataflows within your organization.

My Dataflowsâ†’ For dataflows within your organization.

- Global Dataflowsâ†’ For dataflows at the global level.

Global Dataflowsâ†’ For dataflows at the global level.

## Executing a Cross-Organizational Dataflow

Cross-organizational dataflows allow execution across different organizations.

### Execution Scope

- Global Dataflows:Defined at the global organization level and accessible to all organizations.

- Parent Dataflows:Defined in a parent organization and accessible to both self and its child organizations. Applicable for Connected Organizations.

- Organization Dataflows: Defined in your organization and available only for your organization.

> ðŸ“˜NoteGlobal dataflows execute within the context of the calling organization, even though they are globally defined.Context Switching: Execution can switch from a parent organization to its child organization using a "context switch" block. However, execution cannot switch from a child organization to its parent.A parent organization cannot execute a dataflow from a child organization.

## ðŸ“˜Note

Note

- Global dataflows execute within the context of the calling organization, even though they are globally defined.

- Context Switching: Execution can switch from a parent organization to its child organization using a "context switch" block. However, execution cannot switch from a child organization to its parent.

- A parent organization cannot execute a dataflow from a child organization.

### Testing a Cross-Organizational Dataflow

1. Copy the dataflow cURL.

3. Set thex-cap-neo-dag-scopeHeader.global: Executes a dataflow from the global organization.parent: Executes a dataflow from the parent organization.org: Executes a dataflow from your organization.

Set thex-cap-neo-dag-scopeHeader.

`x-cap-neo-dag-scope`

- global: Executes a dataflow from the global organization.

`global`

- parent: Executes a dataflow from the parent organization.

`parent`

- org: Executes a dataflow from your organization.

`org`

# Observibility & Monitoring

You can view and analyze the performance of your Neo API, the APIs used in the Neo dataflow, view the logs, etc, using theDev Console. The Dev Console helps in the monitoring and debugging process for the dataflow.
