| Hereâ€™s the hard truth Â . Youâ€™re paying a premium for a long-drawn WhatsApp campaign setup process, CRM integration, and basic insights to a Business Solutions Provider (BSP) for your WhatsApp campaigns, especially if you already have an Engage+ subscription. |

|  |

| Four things youâ€™re missing out on: |

| 1. A simple WhatsApp Campaign setup process |

| Engage+ makes any WhatsApp campaign deployment a 2-step process.- Drafting the Campaign message- Deploying it to pre-specified segmentsJust the way it should be. Message approvals are quick, the platform is intuitive, and you can systematize deployment even more with templates. |

| 2. Integration with the most powerful CRM |

| Most BSPs are built for specific CRMs but are also limited by them. Thatâ€™s because not every CRM can capture 360-degree customer information, much less help you make the most out of it. |

| Engage+ connects seamlessly with Capillaryâ€™s CDP, meaning you get access to an intelligent, self-updating CRM round-the-clock. Plus, the system helps you create the best segments (including behavior-based segments) and drive targeted WhatsApp campaigns in a few clicks. |
