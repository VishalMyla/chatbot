# VisitorTrax Overview

VisitorTrax is a device equipped with a fisheye camera that provides a 360-degree view of the store. It can capture from 800 to 1000 square feet.

VisitorTrax shows the heatmap of visitors across different zones of the store or outlet. The most populated area in the store is shown in red, lesser populated areas are shown in orange, and areas with the least number of visitors are marked green. It helps the store managers to analyze the visitor journey in a store. For example, if there are 100 visitors in an XYZ showroom and 70% of them are present in the scooters zone and 20% are in the discussion desk and 10% of them are present in the super-premium zone, as per the number of visitors present in a zone, the scooters zone will be marked red, discussion desk will be orange, super-premium along with other empty zones in the store will be marked as green in the zone map.
