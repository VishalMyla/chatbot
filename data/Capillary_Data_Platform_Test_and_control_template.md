# Test and control template

The Test and Control template allows you to compare and change the customer test and control status in the Capillary platform according to the data provided by the brand.   This helps to reduce the number of API calls that are required to change the status in bulk.

# Use case

Brands send customer data to Capillary to change their test and control status.Using the Test and Control template, you can compare your existing customer data with the customer test and control data provided by the brand to make changes in the customer role in bulk rather than changing the data for each customer.
