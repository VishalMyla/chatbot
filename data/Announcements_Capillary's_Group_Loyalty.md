Hi there,

“Knock knock.”“Who’s there?”“Loyalist”“Loyalist who?”“Loyalist–the person who’s expanding your sales!”

Brand loyalists/influencers are members who would unequivocally recommend your brand to others. Harnessing the power of your most loyal influencers involves recognizing and rewarding them across the board. Without Capillary, that can look like a daunting and messy effort. With Capillary’s Group Loyalty, though, you can build towards one of the most rewarding sales channels.

The power of Group Loyalty

A group loyalty program entails a host of secondary members tied to your primary loyalty member (the influencer). The secondary members can be friends and family of your retail shopper or a business entity/colleagues/partners for B2B organisations.

At group loyalty’s core, an individual group member’s action should lead to the entire group being rewarded. This becomes a powerful tool for B2B and B2C businesses to increase sales, brand affinity and awareness in the following ways:

1. Distributor and CPG incentivization 📦

User group loyalty allows an org to incentivize individuals from business entities that drive profits. Distributors can make money through a percentage of their recruits' sales and also direct sales of products to customers. This becomes a powerful sales channel for CPG and distributor-led businesses with Capillary’s scale support for complex group entities with up to 10,000 members and 6 different roles.

2. Corporate loyalty programs & Fleet Loyalty 🕴

Group loyalty in fleets and corporates has the potential to influence an entire organisation’s behaviour in your interest. If a fleet driver fills petrol from a partner petrol pump, the key driver of your collaboration (manager of the fleet group) can receive points for the transaction. Other members of the company can also be set up to receive the benefits of employee transactions.

3. Friends and family incentives in aviation, retail & healthcare 👪

A friends-and-family set up rewards for the entire group even if one group member transacts. This plays out the best in aviation, retail shopping, and healthcare. This could look like additional points, more miles collection, and collective tier upgrades. A great incentive for the group to encourage each other to transact.

4. B2C and B2B Affiliate programs 💱

Affiliates enrolled (primary loyal members) in a program can directly reap the loyalty benefits of any transactions or acquisitions of new customers brought in by them. Organizations can choose to reward the added members and primary members or just their primary members based on their affiliate program setup and budgets.

CXOs, take note:Decked with extensive customizability options, group loyalty can become one of the most rewarding investments. Reach out to your Capillary Partner to see how you can create a direct business impact.
