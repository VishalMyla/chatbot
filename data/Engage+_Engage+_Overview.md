## How Engage+ is different from Loyalty+

Loyalty promotionsare based on customer activities, meaning a customer earns incentives upon performing a specific activity. For example, earning 2x points on a transaction during their birthday month or receiving 100 points for completing a running milestone.

Engage promotionsprimarily focus on issuing incentives in bulk and delivering them through broadcast campaigns. For instance, issuing 100 points and sending an email to all customers with a birthday this month. These do not require the customer to perform any specific activity.

Engage also includes additional types of promotions:

- DVS (Dynamic Voucher System): Similar to loyalty promotions, these are activity-based, where customers earn incentives upon performing an activity. However, DVS promotions exclusively issue vouchers as incentives. These are typically used by brands not utilising loyalty promotions, as loyalty promotions offer a more comprehensive solution.

- Referral campaigns - Referral campaigns help acquire new customers by leveraging the networks of existing customers. Incentives for these campaigns can include coupons or points and can be configured to reward both the referrer and the referee. Rewards are typically based on specific actions, such as completing a registration or making a transaction.
