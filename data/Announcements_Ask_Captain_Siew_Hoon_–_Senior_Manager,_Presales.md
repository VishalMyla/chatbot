Hi there,

We’re switching things up a little, and you’ve just bagged your front-row seats for the gig. Going through various demo days, product training sessions, and town halls, made us realize that learning is powerful, but even more so when it comes through people’s experiences, triumphs and failures, and learnings.

In light of the same, we’re pleased to announce the first of many – Ask your Captains; an internal interview series that will share the successful recipes used by your fellow captains, their best take on the work we do, and how to do it passionately.

Q. What’s the 1 thing your customers love about Capillary?

A.They love how the product’s maturity doesn’t take away from its immense personalization capabilities, and how future-proof our features in Loyalty are in catering to different customer industries and their requirements. Especially our milestone strategy and behavioral event that can help build brand loyalty through the emotional aspect.Q. What is an achievement you are most proud of?A.A sense of satisfaction is very high in my role. I enjoy listening to prospects from various verticals such as FMCG, QSR, Retail & Mall, Convenience stores, and fuel sharing about their challenges, learning from them how they run their business and what are their business objectives. I have been very lucky to be able to share my thoughts and exchange ideas with these global brands on how they can improve their customer loyalty.Q. What upcoming product/feature launch are you most looking forward to for your customers?A.From a product POV, our updates on the UX/UI are something I’m really looking forward to! When a marketer uses Capillary, we need them to be able to use it easily without feeling intimidated by it.Q. How do you keep yourself up to date on the product?A.I make sure to attend all training sessions, deep dive into all product e-mails, and then use Slack channels for all of my questions. I also talk to Mansi, Harsh, Lalit, and the rest of the product team a lot! I think it’s very important to talk to people to stay up to date.Q.  How do you incorporate upselling into your pre-sales success strategy?A.First, I will try to understand what exciting features we have launched for our existing clients. Then, it's important to understand the market and your client's specific problems. This way, I can offer the latest solutions that are tailored to their needs and successfully upsell. All in all, make it relevant to their vertical and keep them excited about what can be done to improve their loyalty program.Q. What’s the biggest challenge you see when collaborating with different teams? How do you overcome it?A.The biggest challenge has been getting people’s time. I respect that people are busy with lots of different things, but I’ve learned that “you ask,  you get”, and that’s what I do. The team has been very supportive so far, and the interactive Slack channels help a lot too!Q. What are your go-tos after a long day of work? How do you unwind?A.Once my two boys are off to school, I’ll start incorporating a routine into my time. I get some movement in my week through yoga, spinning, and Reformer Pilates, I also Netflix a lot – I enjoy watching Sima Aunty from Indian Matchmaking. I think it’s just important to learn new things and stay curious. Over the years, I have signed up for a few courses for personal growth.We loved hearing about Siew Hoon’s refreshing take on how she approaches work, conversations with clients, and her secrets to upselling – it gave us so much perspective! This is exactly what this internal interview series aims to do. Help us learn through people’s experiences, and also get to know each other a little better!
