# Quickstart for Neo Extension

# Step One - Enable Neo & Get Access

- Enable Neo for your organisation

- Get access permission to use Neo

# Step Two - Access Neo Portal

You can use the url {host}/extensions/neo/ui to access Neo. For example,https://eu.intouch.capillarytech.com/extensions/neo/ui.

# Step Three - Create a Dataflow

With Neo, you can create workflows for the entire development process using drag-and-drop blocks calledbuilding blocks. The workflows built using the drag-and-drop blocks are calleddataflows in Neo. Every data flow starts with a Trigger block, and by default, this block is added automatically. Further, as per your requirement, you can click on the nod in each block, select the next block.
