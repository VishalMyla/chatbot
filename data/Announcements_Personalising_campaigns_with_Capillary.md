Hi there,

Remember when seeing your name in an email subject line seemed like a revolutionary advancement in digital marketing? Today, offering customers tailored experiences that catch their eye requires a far more strategic approach, and is essential to make your mark in an increasingly competitive marketplace ‚Äì and personalising campaigns is a great way to do that!

Here are 4 ways to add personalisation across campaigns

1. Customer Journey üì∂

Customer journeys enable you to create scenario-based flows through multiple touch points to nurture your customers throughout their life cycles. This means you can create more relevant offerings for customers based on their individual journeys on the platform, and configure automation to assist them at every step and that too by simple drag and drop mechanism.

Here are a few examples:‚û°  A special discount offered when a customer reaches the 1 year milestone with your brand.‚û°  Reminder notifications/emails if they‚Äôve left an item in the cart for 2+ days. You could throw in an extra discount to give them an extra nudge!‚û°  A celebratory email on the customer‚Äôs birthday offering some exclusive perks.

2. Broadcast campaigns üîä

Broadcast campaigns are the campaigns that are implemented to target a bulk audience. But that doesn‚Äôt mean you can‚Äôt make it contextual. Using segments, you can group audiences with similar behaviours, geographies or demographics and tailor your messaging to their actions.  A broadcast campaign can include newsletters, promo-campaigns, special offers, featured blog posts or more.

E.g.: If you notice a segment of your audience is the most active in your store during a certain time period, for example 6-8 PM, you can target them with a broadcast campaign offering them a one-time-offer that expires by 8PM across the store.

3. Survey Campaign üìù

76% of customers expect businesses to understand their needs.A properly designed survey campaign will do exactly this. You can survey your customers by creating a set of questions and sending the link through SMS or Email. Survey Campaigns help you understand your audience across different segments, and show you how you can adapt to their needs better too!

E.g.: A customer satisfaction survey email can be personalised and sent with the subject ‚ÄúHappy with your < Product Name >? | Let us know how you feel‚Äù to gather responses. You can also offer a small discount to the customers who finish filling the survey, to thank them for their time and input.

4. Referral Campaign üë•

The Referral Campaigns help you to acquire new customers through your existing customers' network. You can configure your referral program to reward the referrer and the referee when the transaction has taken place. Personalisation is key here too ‚Äì the most successful referral campaigns are tailored to what is relevant to the brand too.

E.g.: Dropbox offers an extra 500 MB of free storage space to the customer who makes the referral, and to the newly referred user. As a result, the company saw its membershipskyrocket by about 60% in 2010.

Adding personalisation to your campaigns, with proper segmentation is a great way to make your brand more memorable, guarantee customer delight, drive revenue and increase customer retention. After all, the most loyal customers are customers who feel the most understood. Reach out to your Capillary partner to understand how you can add personalisation to all your campaigns.
