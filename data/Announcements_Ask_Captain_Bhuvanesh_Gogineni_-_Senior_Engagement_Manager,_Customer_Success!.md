# Ask Captain Bhuvanesh Gogineni - Senior Engagement Manager, Customer Success!

| Hi there,A birdie (our trusty Product team) told us you loved our chat withSiew Hoon, on our last edition ofAsk your Captain. So, we’re back, by popular demand, with yet another insightful conversation this week, one with our stellar CSM. Grab your cuppa and a notebook (for all those golden nuggets) while we hand over the mic to your Captain.Q. Which customers do you assist and how?A. I handle enterprise customers like Redtag, Malabar, and Metro Digital in the EMEA region. As for how I ensure customer success, I focus on the value delivery of the Capillary platform to customers and ensure that they leverage us to make their processes easier. My goal is to make Capillary the first recall whenever the client team wants to launch any new initiative within their organization.Q. What’s the #1 thing your customers love about Capillary?A. Customers love the agility of the Capillary team and the collaborative nature of the platform, given it helps them navigate complex scenarios. Furthermore, with the onboarding of new team members from Brierly and Rewards+, clients now foresee us as a longer-term strategic player compared to our competitors in the market.Q. What is an achievement you are most proud of?A. That’s a hard one. But here are my top two.1. Increased the retainer by 25% and retained a KSA customer during the last 2 weeks of churn notice period.2. Managed to move one of our legacy large enterprise customers from Instore to API first approach in around 1000+ stores in 6 countries.Q. What upcoming product/feature launch are you most looking forward to for your customer?A. I’m most excited about the new product through Rewards+. It’ll be a game changer in the Middle East market and it will give us a lot of competitive edge over other platforms in the space.Q.  How do you keep yourself up to date on the product?A. I ensure to not miss any release notes sent through emails and attend all the product training sessions. Besides that I actively challenge myself for demos with clients, to keep myself updated about our product.Q. How do you incorporate upselling into your customer success strategy?A. First, I make sure that the client uses our product to the fullest. Next, I interact regularly with clients and help them achieve the target KPIs jointly with Capillary. This forms the foundation for the relationship. I believe understanding the client's problems and exploring all possible solutions to the problem first followed by positioning Capillary gives an edge during upsells. Pitching Capillary immediately for every problem, in contrast, makes us look more sales persons than CSMs.Q. What’s the biggest challenge you see when collaborating with different teams? How do you overcome it?A. Collaboration can be difficult between teams given they have goals and targets they’re already working towards. So, I usually follow set cadences and detail my requirements. This helps teams understand and remember them quickly. When things are urgent/not moving, however, I simply pick up the phone. I’ve observed that even a single call can make a big difference. Fortunately, the entire team at Capillary is quite welcoming and collaborative and takes care of my requirements.Q. What are your go-tos after a long day of work? How do you unwind?A. I usually go on a walk around the lake near my house every evening. I keep my phone on silent mode; so that 1 hour is a no-disturbance zone. The sound of the waves and the chirping of birds relieves my entire day’s stress.Q.  What’s a fun/memorable customer interaction you had?A. We were working on a Visitor Metrix device for a client based in Jeddah once. The client CIO requested a specific report, which wasn't a part of Capillary’s offerings. Given that this was an important client, I committed to the CIO that I’d get the report ready within a day and succeeded. Elated by the agility I showed, the CIO took me and his entire team for a very fancy lunch in Jeddah. In fact, he even invited me to his party mansion on my subsequent visit.Learning about Bhuvanesh’s approach to building successful customer relationships, and cross-selling effectively, while maintaining a solid work-life balance was the highlight of our day, and we hope reading this insightful conversation was yours.After serving a successful stint of 8.5 years, Bhuvanesh has decided to move on from Capillary, but will always remain a Captain. Here's hisLinkedIn profile,feel free to drop in good luck & talk about what you loved about him.We’ll be back with sharing interviews with top-performing executives at Capillary soon. Until then, interact with our other talented CSMs on Slack. |  |  |  | Hi there,A birdie (our trusty Product team) told us you loved our chat withSiew Hoon, on our last edition ofAsk your Captain.

Pitching Capillary immediately for every problem, in contrast, makes us look more sales persons than CSMs.Q. What’s the biggest challenge you see when collaborating with different teams? How do you overcome it?A. Collaboration can be difficult between teams given they have goals and targets they’re already working towards. So, I usually follow set cadences and detail my requirements. This helps teams understand and remember them quickly. When things are urgent/not moving, however, I simply pick up the phone. I’ve observed that even a single call can make a big difference. Fortunately, the entire team at Capillary is quite welcoming and collaborative and takes care of my requirements.Q. What are your go-tos after a long day of work? How do you unwind?A. I usually go on a walk around the lake near my house every evening. I keep my phone on silent mode; so that 1 hour is a no-disturbance zone. The sound of the waves and the chirping of birds relieves my entire day’s stress.Q.  What’s a fun/memorable customer interaction you had?A. We were working on a Visitor Metrix device for a client based in Jeddah once. The client CIO requested a specific report, which wasn't a part of Capillary’s offerings. Given that this was an important client, I committed to the CIO that I’d get the report ready within a day and succeeded. Elated by the agility I showed, the CIO took me and his entire team for a very fancy lunch in Jeddah. In fact, he even invited me to his party mansion on my subsequent visit.Learning about Bhuvanesh’s approach to building successful customer relationships, and cross-selling effectively, while maintaining a solid work-life balance was the highlight of our day, and we hope reading this insightful conversation was yours.After serving a successful stint of 8.5 years, Bhuvanesh has decided to move on from Capillary, but will always remain a Captain.

It’ll be a game changer in the Middle East market and it will give us a lot of competitive edge over other platforms in the space. | Q.  How do you keep yourself up to date on the product?A. I ensure to not miss any release notes sent through emails and attend all the product training sessions. Besides that I actively challenge myself for demos with clients, to keep myself updated about our product. | Q. How do you incorporate upselling into your customer success strategy?A.

| Hi there, |

| A birdie (our trusty Product team) told us you loved our chat withSiew Hoon, on our last edition ofAsk your Captain. So, we’re back, by popular demand, with yet another insightful conversation this week, one with our stellar CSM. Grab your cuppa and a notebook (for all those golden nuggets) while we hand over the mic to your Captain. |

|  |

| Q. Which customers do you assist and how?A. I handle enterprise customers like Redtag, Malabar, and Metro Digital in the EMEA region. As for how I ensure customer success, I focus on the value delivery of the Capillary platform to customers and ensure that they leverage us to make their processes easier. My goal is to make Capillary the first recall whenever the client team wants to launch any new initiative within their organization. |

| Q. What’s the #1 thing your customers love about Capillary?A. Customers love the agility of the Capillary team and the collaborative nature of the platform, given it helps them navigate complex scenarios. Furthermore, with the onboarding of new team members from Brierly and Rewards+, clients now foresee us as a longer-term strategic player compared to our competitors in the market. |

| Q. What is an achievement you are most proud of?A. That’s a hard one. But here are my top two.1. Increased the retainer by 25% and retained a KSA customer during the last 2 weeks of churn notice period.2. Managed to move one of our legacy large enterprise customers from Instore to API first approach in around 1000+ stores in 6 countries. |

| Q. What upcoming product/feature launch are you most looking forward to for your customer?A. I’m most excited about the new product through Rewards+. It’ll be a game changer in the Middle East market and it will give us a lot of competitive edge over other platforms in the space. |

| Q.  How do you keep yourself up to date on the product?A. I ensure to not miss any release notes sent through emails and attend all the product training sessions. Besides that I actively challenge myself for demos with clients, to keep myself updated about our product. |

| Q. How do you incorporate upselling into your customer success strategy?A. First, I make sure that the client uses our product to the fullest. Next, I interact regularly with clients and help them achieve the target KPIs jointly with Capillary. This forms the foundation for the relationship. I believe understanding the client's problems and exploring all possible solutions to the problem first followed by positioning Capillary gives an edge during upsells. Pitching Capillary immediately for every problem, in contrast, makes us look more sales persons than CSMs. |

| Q. What’s the biggest challenge you see when collaborating with different teams? How do you overcome it?A. Collaboration can be difficult between teams given they have goals and targets they’re already working towards. So, I usually follow set cadences and detail my requirements. This helps teams understand and remember them quickly. When things are urgent/not moving, however, I simply pick up the phone. I’ve observed that even a single call can make a big difference. Fortunately, the entire team at Capillary is quite welcoming and collaborative and takes care of my requirements. |

| Q. What are your go-tos after a long day of work? How do you unwind?A. I usually go on a walk around the lake near my house every evening. I keep my phone on silent mode; so that 1 hour is a no-disturbance zone. The sound of the waves and the chirping of birds relieves my entire day’s stress. |

| Q.  What’s a fun/memorable customer interaction you had?A. We were working on a Visitor Metrix device for a client based in Jeddah once. The client CIO requested a specific report, which wasn't a part of Capillary’s offerings. Given that this was an important client, I committed to the CIO that I’d get the report ready within a day and succeeded. Elated by the agility I showed, the CIO took me and his entire team for a very fancy lunch in Jeddah. In fact, he even invited me to his party mansion on my subsequent visit. |

| Learning about Bhuvanesh’s approach to building successful customer relationships, and cross-selling effectively, while maintaining a solid work-life balance was the highlight of our day, and we hope reading this insightful conversation was yours. |

| After serving a successful stint of 8.5 years, Bhuvanesh has decided to move on from Capillary, but will always remain a Captain. Here's hisLinkedIn profile,feel free to drop in good luck & talk about what you loved about him. |

| We’ll be back with sharing interviews with top-performing executives at Capillary soon. Until then, interact with our other talented CSMs on Slack. |
