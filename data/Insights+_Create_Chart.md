## Example - Creating a Badges Earned Chart

Consider a scenario where a brand wants to generate reports for the badges earned by their customers. To achieve this, we can create a chart using "Badges Earned" as the KPI, alongside several dimensions like customer tier/slab, latest transaction date (latest updated date), total transaction value, and the customer's loyalty type.

Follow the given steps to create the "Badges Earned" chart:

1. On the Insights+ home page, clickLibrary>Chartsfrom the left navigation panel.

2. ClickCreate Chart.

3. Keep theChart TypeasNormal. Click theKPIdropdown to expand the list of KPIs. Select theBadges EarnedKPI from the list or type badges in the search box to locate the KPI. ClickSelect.

4. Click theDimensiondropdown to expand the list of dimensions. Select the following dimensions -Slab Name; Total Sales and Loyalty Type(underCustomers); and Date (underLatest Updated Date). ClickSelect.

5. ClickApply. This will populate the chart values and shown in the preview.

6. Name the chart and clickCreate. The chart with the specified KPIs and dimensions is created and is now available in the chart list. Click on the chart to view or edit it. This chart can be incorporated into a report for deeper analysis and reporting.

### Chart Analysis

The chart shows the distribution of badges earned by customers across different loyalty slabs and dates. The majority of badges (43%) were earned by customers in the 0-1000 loyalty slab on 2024-08-04. Another significant portion (29%) was earned by customers in the same loyalty slab on 2024-08-05. Higher loyalty slabs, such as Gold and Platinum, accounted for fewer badges earned, with 14% badges earned on 2024-08-13 and 2024-08-28, respectively.

### Key Insights

Lower Loyalty Slab Engagement: Customers in the 0-1000 loyalty slab are more active in earning badges, indicating higher engagement or possibly a larger customer base in this segment.Lower Badge Activity in Higher Tiers: The Gold and Platinum tiers show lower badge earning activity, which could imply fewer customers or less engagement in these segments.This chart helps identify which customer segments are most active and where there might be opportunities to boost engagement, especially in the higher loyalty tiers.

## Example - Promotion Funnel Drop-off Detection

Scenario: Identify customers left from any page (stage/step) during the product promotion process. It could be due to poor experience, a slow site, unexpected costs, or other factors that influence the objective (points allocation) during an email promotion.Solution: Here, the funnel chart helps visualize points allocation conversion steps through different transition levels. You can focus on the events - Added to cart and Check out, where many audiences are not moving towards the goal.

Example: Consider you have selected report duration from 1 March to 30 September and a funnel completion time of 10 days.

Table below gives the case scenarios where report duration is from1 Marchto30 Septemberand a funnel completion time of10 days.

| Case Scenario | Customerâ€™s funnel start date (first step) | Customerâ€™s funnel end date (last step) | Availability of funnel steps during analysis (report creation) |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| 1 | 5 March | 14 March | Include the customer with all the steps (as all the steps are completed in the funnel completion time of 10 days, within the report duration). |

| 2 | 22 September | 1 October | Include the steps from 22nd September to 30th September performed by the customer (only till 30th September as 1st October exceeds the report duration). |

| 3 | 10 August | 30 August | Include the steps from 10th August to 19th August performed by the customer (as funnel completion time is 10 days). |

| 4 | 10 August | Not ended | Include the steps from 10th August to 19th August performed by the customer. |



> ðŸ“˜NoteThe first step should start within the report duration to be a part of the funnel chart analysis.

## ðŸ“˜Note

Note

The first step should start within the report duration to be a part of the funnel chart analysis.

Hence, you can track the sum of the actions of all the customers who enter the funnel by performing Step 1, from1 Marchto30 September, and exit it within 10 days by calculating; The number of converted customers between each step and the customer conversion rate between each step.

Table below gives the detailed data of the funnel chart presentation.

| Events | Number of Customers | Customer Attrition Rate (%) |

| --- | --- | --- |

| Product viewed | 55 | 0% |

| Product viewed > Added to cart | 39 | 29% |

| Added to cart > Check out event | 13 | 66% |

| Check out event > Product review | 0 | 100% |
