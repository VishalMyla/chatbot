# Points Standard Export Templates

There are 3 export templates for points data.

# Points

The Points template is based on thePointsfact.

[Points](/docs/points-fact-table)

- With this template you can export the data of points related events such as points issual, and points deduction (redeemed, expired, and returned).

- You will get only the detailed break up of deducted points but not the summarized one.

- The template will have the filters “redeemable” and “not applicable (deducted)”, applied by default.

> 📘NotePoints that are redeemed will be tagged to a transaction, only if both the transaction and points redemption occurs within the span of +/- 15 minutes.
