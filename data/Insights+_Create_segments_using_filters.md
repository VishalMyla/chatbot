# Create segments using filters

## Introduction

Segments are equipped with predefined rules using which you can set conditions for each partition. The segment details are updated automatically based on the ruleset. Rule-based segments are usually SCD and activity-based.

For example, you can have a segment based on RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) and have partitions as explained below:

- Champions:  High spending customers who purchased recently and also shop quite often(Last Txn Date in the last 10 days) AND (Latency < 25) AND (Lifetime Purchased > 500)

Champions:  High spending customers who purchased recently and also shop quite often(Last Txn Date in the last 10 days) AND (Latency < 25) AND (Lifetime Purchased > 500)

- Loyal Customers: A frequent shopper and responsive to promotions.(Last Txn Date in the last 30 days) AND (Latency between 25 and 45) AND (Lifetime Purchased between 200 and 500)
