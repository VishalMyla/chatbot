# Different payment modes for rewards in the catalog

Brands can now expand their rewards catalog to include options to purchase rewards with cash, fixed points, variable points, or a combination of both, providing customers with greater flexibility and more reasons to engage with the loyalty program. With options including FREE, POINTS, CASH, CONV_RATIO and POINTS_CASH, brands gain enhanced flexibility and control over reward issuance.

This feature enables customers to receive a reward either by redeeming their points or by making a cash payment or both. Cash transactions or any other mode of payment occur outside the system and are not subject to validation within the system.

### The supported payment modes are:

1. FREE: This payment mode incurs zero cost, requiring neither points nor cash.

2. POINTS: Loyalty points are redeemed from the customer's wallet to issue the reward.

3. CASH: The reward is issued without redemption or validation, assuming the tender transaction occurred outside the system (upstream system).

4. POINTS_CASH: In this payment mode, the system issues rewards based on redeeming both cash and loyalty points from the customer's wallet. The assumption here is that the cash transaction has been completed successfully, and the reward is issued based solely on this external transaction.

5. CONV_RATIO: The rewards system calculates the equivalent miles based on the points provided in the issue reward request basis the conversion ratio of the reward. For example:If the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants to burn 1500 points and the same points worth of miles need to be credited to his account, the rewards system calculates miles worth 1500 points based on the conversion ratio value i.e. 1500*0.44 = 660 milesIf the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants 1000 miles to be credited. The reward system calculates the points to be redeemed i.e. 1000/0.44= 2272 points will be deducted.

1. If the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants to burn 1500 points and the same points worth of miles need to be credited to his account, the rewards system calculates miles worth 1500 points based on the conversion ratio value i.e. 1500*0.44 = 660 miles

2. If the conversion ratio value is 0.44 and the customer wants 1000 miles to be credited. The reward system calculates the points to be redeemed i.e. 1000/0.44= 2272 points will be deducted.

8. Defining multiple payment modes for a single reward : Offer rewards with multiple payment options, giving customers the flexibility to choose their preferred payment method. For example,Customers can get the cinema ticket either in 16,000 Points OR 10,000 ShowPoints + $72Customers can get the merchandise in 1000 points OR 500 points + 5$ or 10$

1. Customers can get the cinema ticket either in 16,000 Points OR 10,000 ShowPoints + $72

2. Customers can get the merchandise in 1000 points OR 500 points + 5$ or 10$

During the issue call, the system records the payment mode used to issue the reward at the reward level.
