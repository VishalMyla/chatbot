Weekly product highlight: Subscription-based Loyalty

Capillary’s Subscription-based loyalty

Driving CLTV with subscription-based incentives

Hi there,

Subscription based loyalty has helped brands dramatically improve their most relevant metrics like brand affinity and customer lifetime value. While on the surface it may seem like a normal loyalty program with a fee, it’s so much more powerful than that in effect. In this mail, we’re going deeper into how brands can start leveraging subscription-based loyalty to their advantage.

Why should brands introduce subscription-based loyalty?

Some of a brand’s most loyal customers often find themselves coming back to the brand in regular intervals. When such customers aren’t identified and acknowledged, it’s a huge miss for the brands – since their purchase revenue isn’t booked until the actual purchase, there is a greater variable in revenue generation.

59% shoppers are more likely to choose a brand they've subscribed to over competitors
