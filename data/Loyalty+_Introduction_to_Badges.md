# Introduction to Badges

# Overview of Badges

Badges are a type of visual recognition used in loyalty programs to reward customers for their progress, specific actions or achievements. These serve as a form of gamification and a sense of pride and accomplishment within the user, reinforcing the targeted behaviours and boosting engagement.

# Purposes and benefits

Customers want to build deeper relationships with brands beyond transaction and that’s where emotional loyalty comes into play. Customers are recognized and appreciated for the effort that they put in, the money they spend, and their loyalty towards the same brand. Hence, Badges tap into the emotional side of the customers making them hooked to your brand, giving a more fulfilling experience, moving beyond the realm of mere transactions and discounts.
