# Available to Issue loyalty promotion

The "Available without issue" promotions also called GENERIC promotions in the backend are accessible to all customers and are automatically triggered to provide benefits such as points or tier upgrades based on predefined rules, behavioural events, or milestone completions. They are aimed at rewarding customer loyalty and fostering repeat purchases. This is similar to the basic promotion.

These promotions are not specifically issued to individual customers instead benefits are directly provided to the customers when they meet the defined criteria. When a customer meets the requirements, the promotion is automatically applied to their transaction, resulting in the issuance of benefits such as loyalty points, tier upgrades, coupons, or badges.
