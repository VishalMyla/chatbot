# Select data templates (Step 2 of 3)

A template is a combination of facts, dimensions, and/or KPIs. Standard templates are created from facts, and dimensions whereas a custom dimension is a combination of KPIs and dimensions.  Standard templates consist of raw data whereas custom templates can have summarized data. For example, Standard templates consist of columns such as points issued, total visits, purchases, and so on at the customer level, i.e., basically the columns which are summarized.  However, if you need these values for a specific duration, you need custom templates.

To create a custom template, see Creating Custom Templates.
