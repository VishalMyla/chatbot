### Enable subscription status syncing across OUs (for MLP enabled orgs)

Orgs with multiple org units can engage a customer through different org units of the org. The customer gives confirmation for opt-ins and opt-outs through the option configured for the org unit.

- Opt-in to all OUs if subscription entry from any of the OUs is Opt-in: Check this option to opt-in customers to all org units If they opt-in to any of the org units.

For example, assume the org has four org units - OU1, OU2, OU3, and OU4. if a customer opts into OU3, enabling this option will opt in the customer to OU1, OU2, and OU4 also.

- Opt-out from all OUs if the first subscription entry from any of the OUs is Opt-out: Check this option to opt-out customers from all org units of the org if they were to opt-out from any of the org units.

For example, in the preceding example, if a customer opt-outs from OU2, enabling this option will opt out the customer from the other OUs as well - OU1, OU3, and OU4
