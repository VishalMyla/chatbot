# Audience management

Audience Manager lets you create different audience groups based on specific information. Creating audience groups helps you target right customer at right time which makes campaigns more effective. You can create and manage groups seperately based on information like behavior, interests, demographic details, transactions, and more. For example, you can get high spending customers that did not visit your stores for the last three months.

There are three ways of creating audience groups -

1. Upload CSV file

2. Apply filter conditions

3. Use existing groups.

4. Import via FTP connector

# Using audience filters

Filters facilitate the effectiveness of a campaign by targeting the right customers in the right context. You can build an audience group based on specific information in a certain period. The information could be on behavior, interests, demographic details, transactions, and more. For example, you can get high spending customers that did not visit your stores for the last three months.

With filters you can:

- Create  audience groups using various predefined filters such as transactions, customer details, demographics, custom field details, and loyalty information

- Optimize a group using multiple filters to get a specific intended customer list. For example, you can build an audience group that purchased during Dec 1, 2021 - Jan 31, 2022 with marital status married.

- You can either use and/or operators between two filters.

- You can reuse an audience list in other campaigns.

This section focuses only on creating an audience list through filters (Apply filter condition).

To create an audience group through filters:

1. When creating campaigns, after creating the message type and clickNext

> ðŸ“˜Combined audience lists remain staticWhen you create an audience filter by combining two existing groups, the resulting dataset remains static. This means that any changes made to the two parent groups afterwards will not be reflected in this new dataset.For instance, let's consider audience lists A and B. A includes elements 1, 2, and 3, while B includes elements 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6. If you create a new audience list C by selecting common elements from A and B, C will contain 1 and 2.However, even if you later update A to include elements 1, 2, 3, and 5, the changes will not impact C. C will continue to include only elements 1 and 2.

# Import via FTP connector

This option enables you to create the audience list using the imported audience file available on the FTP server, thus allowing you to fetch customer lists from an external source daily. This external source could be other than the Capillary database.

This avoids the need to use theSegments capability on Insights+to create audience groups containing customers from a source other than the Capillary database, such as a client FTP or a third-party FTP.
