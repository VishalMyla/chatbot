# Cart Promotions

To use cart promotions, you need to first generate an authentication token as an admin using the/aryaAPI and then use theBearerTokenauthentication to make API calls.

`/arya`

You can also pass the token as header. For example, access token is xyz, then pass the headerAUTH-COOKIEwith value Bearer xyz

`AUTH-COOKIE`

Note that only admins can make these promotion API calls.
