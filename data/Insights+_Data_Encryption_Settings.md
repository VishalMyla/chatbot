If necessary, you can encrypt your export data to safeguard sensitive information. The export data is encrypted using a process that involves public-private key encryption. Users configure public keys for encryption within the Insights platform. These public keys are then used to encrypt the export data. When setting up an export, users have the option to choose the security type for encryption. They can select encryption and specify the public key to be used for encrypting the data. Once the export configuration is finalized and initiated, the export framework extracts the data and encrypts it using the selected public key. Only authorized parties with access to the corresponding private key can decrypt and access the original data.

To set the public keys, perform the following:

1. Navigate toSettings > Public keys > Add new public key.
