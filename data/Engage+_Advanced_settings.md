## Test and control ratio

Test and Control is the audience group ratio between who receives the campaign communication and who does not. The test and Control ratio determines the effectiveness of a campaign by comparing the sales generated through the test audience and the control audience.

- Test audience: This audience group receives campaign communication.

- Control audience: This audience group does not receive the campaign communication.

### Type of Test & Control:

- Organization level: Test and control audience remains the same for all the campaigns. Recommended for a long duration, to track the performance of all the campaigns.

- Campaign level: Different campaigns will have different test & control audiences. Recommended for short (campaign) duration, to track the performance of a particular campaign.

> ðŸ“˜Note: We recommended you use either campaign level test & control or org level test & control. If you use both methods, the result data will not be effective.
