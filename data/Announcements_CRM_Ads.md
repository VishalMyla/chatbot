Social media ads ROI

Social media engagement gives customers access to a platform of content, deals, and community-based interactions that is constantly expanding. To brands, it gives the opportunity to use rich media and dynamic messaging for greater engagement. It’s the playground for building engaging and rewarding relationships.

Here’s how you can boost ROI with social media & Capillary’s Engage+

1. Increase retention with social media

Chances of repeat buyers making transactions is 3.75X higher than targeting any new buyers. Reaching your customers on FB, Instagram and partner networks helps bypass DND and inactive SMS or email contacts. Since CRM Ads are not limited to opt-ins, you can reach a greater audience.

Capillary suggests: Create campaigns with an experiential hook and gratification of an additional accessory gift on minimum purchase amounts.

2. Maximum ROI with personalized communication

When the right set of users are targeted with the right content, it can increase your success ratio by 3X. The biggest benefit of Capillary’s social media ads is complex segmentation based on historic CRM data.

Capillary suggests: Use this to run personalized campaigns based on CRM stages, upcoming events, last purchases, seasons, etc.
