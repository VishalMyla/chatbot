Currently, there is no validation that bill amount should match with sum of line items as the data is accepted as it is from POS or integration

Following are the key functionalities of the transaction/add API.

- Registers customers automatically when a new identifier is passed with the transaction details.

- If any identifier matches with another accounts, customer accounts will be merged if the config mentioned below is not enabled.

- If CONFIG_SKIP_SECONDARY_ID_ON_PRIMARY_MISMATCH is enabled, if the primary identifier is different but any of the secondary identifiers exist, a new customer is registered with the primary identifier ignoring the secondary identifier. The config is available on the Registration Page of InTouch Profile > Organization Settings > Miscellaneous.

- Also, this config overrides CONF_PRIMARY_IDENTIFIER_STRICT_CHECK.

- Updates customer details if a registered identifier is passed with different customer details (other than customer identifiers).

- Supports transactions with Product Variant and Product Bundle details.

- Adds product variant to the database when a new variant product is passed with an existing base product.

- Adds base product to the database when a new base product/variant product is passed. However, if a new base product is passed with variant details, it adds only base product and ignores variant.

- For Multi Loyalty Programs, points can be grouped by their respective program IDs and correctly reflected in the side effects section of the response. To enable this, raise a JIRA ticket with the Sustenance team to activate the configurationCONF_ENABLE_GROUP_POINTS_BY_PROGRAMfor your org.
