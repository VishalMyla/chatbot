# Schedule an export job & fetch details

Before starting with scheduling an export job, ensure that the FTP server is configured for Data Export.An export job could be a recurring event or one-time activity. In a recurring event, only fresh data is downloaded every time the scheduled job runs. For example, if a user has scheduled an export job to run for one month on a daily basis, only the previous day's data will be exported every day for one month.

Note:The system does not assure a fixed finish time for the jobs. The export framework picks up a job according to the order of scheduled time.

Configuring an export schedule involves the following steps:

1. Create an Export Job (Step 1 of 3)export job]

2. Select Data Templates (Step 2 of 3)templates that you want to export]

3. Modifying Template & Creating Schedule (Step 3 of 3)templates to add or remove fields, apply filters and dimensions to export a specific data that you need
