Hi there,

“80% of consumers are more likely to make a purchase when brands offer personalized experiences” –Epsilon

Rooted deeply in consumer data across multiple touchpoints, leading marketers choose segmentation as a great tool for increasing conversions. Done right, segmentation can help prioritize business initiatives, increase sales and enhance consumer experience. So what really is segmentation?

Customer Segmentation is a logical grouping of audiences based on shared characteristics. These characteristics include behavioral, demographic or transactional shared traits of customers.

Segments are used to tailor the marketing efforts of brands effectively. The segments are used for effective targeting and reporting in modules such as Campaigns, Loyalty, and Essential Insights.

Using customer segments

1. For acquisition :

Segmentation aids in understanding your consumers, building look-alikes and improved targeting for greater ROI in acquisition.

2. For retention:

Prioritize retention efforts better with segmentation. For a business that wants to prioritize retention efforts for at-risk customers, segmentation will help you identify high spending customers first to ensure maximum effort focus for least business impact.

3. For CLTV projection:

Customer lifetime value can be more accurately projected through better understanding of a consumer’s journey through different segments.

4. For business planning:

Understanding market trends on the other hand, allows a business to identify untapped opportunities — for instance, segmenting consumers by geography can help businesses identify opportunities of new stores based on consumer density.

Creating customer segments with Capillary Insights+

Using rules & conditions :With Capillary’s industry-leading segmentation filters, you can define rules for each partition of a segment.

Rule-based segments are dynamic. This is a power feature for Capillary users since they are updated automatically. This reduces the  redundancy of updating multiple lists.

Upload customer list :Another way of creating segments in Insights+ is by uploading the customer list with customer identifier and segment value (partition name).

The segments created through upload are static. If you want to update an existing segment, you need to upload the new file manually.
