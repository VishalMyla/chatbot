RCS combines the messaging features of popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger but delivered through the default SMS messaging app. RCS is delivered as an SMS but supports extensive media support such as images, videos, branding, CTAs (Call to Actions) and more. Unlike SMS, RCS facilitates you to track the metrics of the message like open rate and link click rate.

Capillary provides various communication channels (SMS, Email, WhatsApp) to engage with brands' customers. With the advancing trends, it becomes very important to reach out to customers efficiently,  capture their attention, and keep them engaged.

### Features of RCS

- Allows brands to send media messages such as images, videos, and carousel media messages, add CTA buttons in messages. It also has better UX.

- Enables brands to have their verified profile, business profile picture, and bio which increases the brand’s verifiability.

- RCS offers detailed analytics of executed campaigns. This includes messages delivered, opened and link click rates.

- Capillary allows brands to configure fallback SMS within an RCS Campaign so that users who are not reachable on RCS can be automatically reached out through SMS.Fallback SMS mechanism:  When a certain audience is not reachable through RCS, then the system will send the configured fallback SMS to the user. Brands can easily reach out to all customers through one campaign and do not need to run separate campaigns for RCS and SMS. A possible small set of users who might not receive will directly get an SMS, so communication to each user is done through one campaign.

- Fallback SMS mechanism:  When a certain audience is not reachable through RCS, then the system will send the configured fallback SMS to the user. Brands can easily reach out to all customers through one campaign and do not need to run separate campaigns for RCS and SMS. A possible small set of users who might not receive will directly get an SMS, so communication to each user is done through one campaign.
