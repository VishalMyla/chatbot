Hi there,

According to a survey conducted among brand marketers at over 250 enterprise customers at Capillary, more than 50% of marketers stated that writing, editing, and optimizing content for different channels takes up the majority of their time.

AskAira aims to alleviate this problem by using AI to suggest appropriate messaging and personalized content for each customer. Here are all the ways AskAira is a godsend for content marketers around the globe:

We got to chat with the Chief Digital Officer and VP at the brand, to walk us through how him and his team upped their loyalty game.

Let‚Äôs dive in!

1. Auto-generated content personalization ‚úçÔ∏è

Aira can generate content tailored to your brand to effectively engage your target audience and drive conversions. All you need to add will be a prompt ‚Äì it‚Äôs that easy!

2. Channel-focused content adaptation ‚ú®

Along with being tailored to your brand‚Äôs tone of voice, the content generated will adapt to the character limits of the communication channel you have chosen.

3. Generate multiple copy options, and personalize on the go üèÉ

AskAira will generate multiple options for each message. If you like a certain option more than the others, you can also ask the bot to generate more options that are similar to the one you liked best!
A successful omni-channel campaign will interact with their customers where they are most responsive, and likely to make a purchase from.

4. Add labels to different users and campaigns üîé

You can add labels to personalize tags for different users, to navigate through your data more seamlessly. These labels can be incorporated into your messages as well.

5. Capture emotions in each content piece ü•∞

Not only does AskAira help in generating content tailored to your brand‚Äôs tone of voice, but it also captures the desired sentiment in each content piece to effectively engage customers. Moreover, it will also label the emotion brought out in each content suggestion.

Today, the adoption of AI tools is on the rise. What makes AskAira stand out from the rest (and what we‚Äôre most excited to share about it as well), is its vast capabilities across our product suite. This means, its immensely reliable AI capabilities are strong enough to support everything across Loyalty+, Engage+, Insights+ & Platforms, and is slated to gradually be integrated across all of our modules, moving towards a smarter future.
