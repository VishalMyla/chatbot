# Create target based on Behavioural eventpost

Behavioral events are a way using which brands track the behavioral properties of their customers. For example:

1. Whether a user has updated the profile picture?

2. Whether a user has provided the product review?

3. Whether a user has walked 5000 steps?

Using the milestones, brands can track these behavioral events and reward their users. For example:

1. Give 100 points to the user for updating the profile picture 2 times a month.

2. Give a $1 coupon to the user for giving 3 product reviews in a quarter.

3. Give a fitness badge to the user for walking 5000 steps in 2 days.

> 📘NoteUnlike targets such as QUANTITY, SALES, GROSS_SALES, REGULAR_POINTS, PROMOTIONAL_POINTS,ALL_POINTS, EXTENDED_FIELD, where the user has to make 3 API calls (target-group, period, and target) to create a single target, the behavioural type of targets can be created using a single call by placing the entire information in the single call itself. It means the definition of all the keys will be the same except for the following:

Note

Unlike targets such as QUANTITY, SALES, GROSS_SALES, REGULAR_POINTS, PROMOTIONAL_POINTS,ALL_POINTS, EXTENDED_FIELD, where the user has to make 3 API calls (target-group, period, and target) to create a single target, the behavioural type of targets can be created using a single call by placing the entire information in the single call itself. It means the definition of all the keys will be the same except for the following:

1. targetEntity = "Event".

2. eventName = "name of the behavioral event".This key will be present in the request body for the behavioural event type of targets.
