1. In theCommunication Channels, enable the Setup Communication toggle button to set mandatory channels and priority channels.

![1002](https://files.readme.io/25a09ef-comms2.png)

Mandatory Channels: Channels that are mandatory for sending the notificationsPriority Channels: Channels that need to be triggered based on priority and availability. For example, if Mobile is set as priority 1, Mobile Push as priority 2, and email as priority 3, the system first checks whether SMS is configured and then checks if the mobile number is available for the customer. If anyone fails, then it will try to send the notification through mobile push and so on.

For example, consider for a tier upgrade event, SMS is set as a Mandatory Channel and the priority channels are eMail (1) and WeChat (2). When a tier is upgraded for the customers mentioned in the following table, notifications are sent based on the channel availability and configuration settings as explained below.

| Channel | SMS | eMail | WeChat |

| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| Customer A | Ma | Ea | Wa |

| Customer B | Mb | - | Wb |

| Customer C | - | Ec | - |



- Customer A will get an SMS on Ma and an eMail on Ea.

- Customer B will get an SMS on Mb and a WeChat message on Wb.

- Customer C will not get an SMS and gets an eMail on Ec.

1. Click Done.

> ðŸ“˜Channels that are selected in Mandatory Channels will not appear in Priority Channels and vice versa.

## ðŸ“˜

Channels that are selected in Mandatory Channels will not appear in Priority Channels and vice versa.

- For notifications configured for external sources such as Facebook, if a specific channel is not available for a customer, then the notification is sent through identifiers available in internal sources (such as mobile no. and WeChat). For example, consider that an org (that is in both internal and external channels) wants to send an SMS for a Facebook event. Based on the channel availability on a customer's Facebook account, notifications are sent as explained in the following.

| Source | Facebook (External) | Ecrm (Internal) |

| --- | --- | --- |

| Customer A | Maf | Mae |

| Customer B | Mbf | - |

| Customer C | - | Mce |



If an SMS notification is sent for a Facebook event:

- Customer A gets a message on mobile Maf.

- Customer B gets a message on mobile Mbf.

- Customer C gets a message on mobile Mce.

If an SMS is sent for an eCRM event:

- Customer A gets a message on mobile Mae.

- Customer B wonâ€™t get any message.

- Customer C gets a message on mobile Mce.
