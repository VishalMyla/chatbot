# Reward Payment Currency Fact

Brands can issue rewards individually or in bulk. This table captures the transaction event where a reward is issued, including themode of paymentused for redeeming the reward. It has entries based on the type of reward and the type of mode of payment.

Customers can purchase rewards with cash, fixed points, variable points, or a combination of both. So, if a customer chooses to use points plus cash, the system issues rewards based on redeeming both cash and points from the customer's wallet. In this case, even for a single reward, two entries will be made in this fact table, as it would capture the total number of points needed and the total amount of cash needed for the reward issual, as separate entries.
