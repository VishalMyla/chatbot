# Configure SFTP server for data export

You can export data only to an SFTP server. Insights+  supports configuring up to five SFTP servers and using the desired one while configuring an export job.  For example, you can have one dedicated to Capillary internal exports and others for org exports based on the location. From the SFTP location, you can then download data to your local machine.
