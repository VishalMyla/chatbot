Hi there,

I’m Rohan–Head of Product at Capillary. I wanted to kickstart this year by personally sharing our
                    product vision for the year.

Over the last few months, the team has put together a lot of research and feedback to map out our
                    product strategy for 2023. Not just are we aiming to bring your product wishlists to life, but we’re
                    doing that in a way that’s got the team truly excited. We’re setting you up to be the industry
                    leaders with the following 4 themes:

We’re beyond the era of loyalty remaining static.Capillary has led the loyalty race by a big margin in
                            establishing legacy loyalty programs. The product team
                            is now raising the bar by setting up truly experiential
                            loyalty programs that take away transactional
                            associations and replace them with experiential
                            relationships.

Loyalty setups, CDPs, and engagement campaigns are now going to make marketing fun again. In 2023, the product team will aim to build features supported by the most user-friendly UI UX, that will make configuring loyalty programs feel as easy and fun as getting free playtime.

Most loyalty CDPs today may be unable to support enterprise scalability. Enterprises need robust backends, vertical alignment, and fast go-live times that are customer-first. In 2023, Capillary will put together the gold standard for enterprise readiness.

Loyalty solutions today provide little emphasis on customer privacy, security & bias concerns. We have always had high standards for privacy and data security. In 2023, we’re going a step further to build toward the most unbiased, locally compliant, and secure CDP for you and your customers.

The energy of the product team to make these come to life is palpable. We’re excited because we’re
                    taking on some big challenges. And across this field of complicated problem statements lies what
                    we’re looking forward to most– industry-leading retention and engagement for you.

I’m looking forward to the ride and grateful you’re with us for it. Here’s to an energetic 2023.

Cheers!
