| periodName* | String | The name of the period/cycle. The is used to identify to which period/cycle, the customer should be enrolled/re-enrolled in the case of milestones.Note: For Streaks, It is not mandatory to enter the period name as the period is not applicable for streaks. |

| initialBalance | Integer | When a value is entered in this field, the user will enroll or re-enroll in the milestone's cycle or period, with the initial balance set to the user's target achieved value.For re-enrollment, if this field is set to "NULL," the user's target achieved value will resume from the value at which the user last unenrolled.This field does not apply to streaks and is applicable only to milestones. |
