# Create target based on EMF eventpost

EMF Events are nothing but the different kinds of customer-level events present in loyalty workflows. For example, returnTransaction, pointsRedemption, etc... and all these are different kinds of EMF events in our systems.

Important note:

Now, brands will be able to create targets based on these EMF events. Now, unlike the normal targets, where the user has to make 3 API calls (target-group, period, and target) to create a single target, the EMF type of targets can be created using a single call by placing the entire information in the single call itself. It means the definition of all the keys will be the same except for the following:

1. targetEntity = "Event".

2. eventName = "name of the emf event".This is a new key that will be present in the request body for the behavioral event type of targets.As of today, we are only supporting the following:CustomerRegistrationPointsRedemptionReturnBillPointsTransfer

1. This is a new key that will be present in the request body for the behavioral event type of targets.

2. As of today, we are only supporting the following:CustomerRegistrationPointsRedemptionReturnBillPointsTransfer

1. CustomerRegistration

2. PointsRedemption

3. ReturnBill

4. PointsTransfer

9. targetType = "COUNT"/"VISIT". Only these 2 are supported for the EMF event type of targets.
