# Using Milestones? Think beyond gamification 🎮

| Hi there,If you’re a teeny bit aware about Milestones, you know that they allow you to:➡️ Build brand-favoring habits with progressive rewarding➡️ Emotionally engage customers with a gamified loyalty experience➡️ Recognize and reward your most loyal customers better to deepen relationshipsPlus, your customers will spendreally long periods of time(we mean months on end, remember Candy Crush, anyone? 🫣) completing milestones, thereby being engaged with you for longer. And that’s an incredibly powerful thing.But what if you could do more with milestones? What if you could use them to influence your campaign strategy? That’s what Hipin, our Director of Customer Success suggested when asked about the different ways we could use milestones.“(A lot) of individual brands do about 50% of their business through multi-brand retail outlets or e-commerce where they don’t know who their customers are, what they are buying and they cannot go about incentivizing them,” he said. “Here, milestones could be a means to identify–can I start capturing my share of wardrobe, can I start rewarding customers with stamps and badges, and recognize and incentivize them when they do a next purchase on a channel,” he added.Genius!Here’s the entire list of customer actions you can track with Capillary Milestones.That means you can include milestones in your customer journeys, not just to modulate customer behaviors but also test them and collect behavioral data. And you can use this data to inform your strategy.For instance, if you run a retail brand, you could create a test milestone(minus attaching the reward)to see how often your customers purchase a particular garment. And if you find that the SKU flies off the shelf slowly, you can build a campaign strategy to increase purchase frequency, and so on.Milestones can help you do a lot of cool stuff. Some you can figure out through these newsletters. For the rest, our experts can help you out. Reach out to our CSMs to understand how you could use milestones for your specific business use case.
