# Accessing Vulcan UI

The Vulcan UI lets you access and manage your applications within the Vulcan platform. Users have different permission levels to view and access Vulcan applications. Refer toAccess Rolesfor information on the access roles. For access, create a JIRA ticket to the Capillary product support team. For more information, refer to the user management documentationhere.

To access the Vulcan UI, follow these steps:

1. On the InTouch portal, click onHomein the left-hand corner.

2. SelectVulcanfrom the sidebar menu.

## Access Roles

Accessing Vulcan involves various permission levels tailored to specific roles within the development and management process.

The roles are as follows:

| Role | Description |

| --- | --- |

| VULCAN VIEWER | This access level is for users to view the application without making any changes.Users with this level cannot modify or manage the application. |

| VULCAN DEVELOPER | This access level is for developers actively working on application development and testing.Users with DEV access can upload new builds to the platform and enable or disable User Acceptance Testing (UAT) mode. |

| VULCAN ADMIN | This access level is for administrators managing the overall application.Users with ADMIN access can create new applications, enable or disable User Acceptance Testing (UAT) mode, enable or disable production (PROD) mode, and delete applications. |

| VULCAN SUPERADMIN | This access level is for super administrators.Users with SUPERADMIN access can delete applications, setup, modify, and delete cluster CF configurations, and override Member Care UI.This is currently restricted to the Capillary engineering team. |



# Application Setup

Setting up an application on Vulcan involves two steps:

- Creating and configuring the application on Vulcan UI.

- Initializing the project on your local machine.

Start by configuring the application on the Vulcan UI. This includes entering the basic details, selecting the appropriate application type, and configuring internationalization settings.

After completing the setup on Vulcan UI, initialize the project on your local machine. This includes setting up the development environment, providing necessary credentials, and configuring project details and endpoints.

## Application Setup in Vulcan UI

To create and configure your application on the Vulcan UI, follow these steps:

1. Access the Vulcan UI pagefrom InTouch.

2. ClickCreate applicationon the Vulcan UI.

#### Types of Vulcan applications

There are three types of applications available on Vulcan:

| Type | Description |

| --- | --- |

| Global | Accessible to all organizations and clusters and not editable once created. |

| Native | Accessible to a specific organization and shareable with other organizations. |

| External Apps | Not currently supported. |



> ðŸ“˜NotesCreating global applications requires Capillary Organization access and Vulcan ADMIN permissions.Native and external applications can be edited or deleted by users with Vulcan ADMIN access.Global and native apps are embedded in Member Care, they use InTouch authentication by default  and do not require additional authentication.

## ðŸ“˜Notes

Notes

- Creating global applications requires Capillary Organization access and Vulcan ADMIN permissions.

- Native and external applications can be edited or deleted by users with Vulcan ADMIN access.

- Global and native apps are embedded in Member Care, they use InTouch authentication by default  and do not require additional authentication.

### Internationalization Details

The internationalization (I18n) setup in Vulcan allows developers to configure applications to support multiple languages and regional settings.

> ðŸ“˜Note:Vulcan provides built-in support for InTouch (Locize) or the option to implement a custom API-based solution for internationalization.

### RBAC Details

Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) allows you to configure and whitelist Vulcan APIs used within a microsite, ensuring secure and structured access. When RBAC is enabled for a Vulcan application, API access is restricted by app ID, and only users with the required permissions (through a membership group or permission set) can access and execute the whitelisted Vulcan APIs. When RBAC is disabled for an application, all Vulcan APIs are accessible to all users. Refer to the documentation onManaging User Permissionsfor more information on managing permissions.

> ðŸ“˜Note:This feature is supported for native Vulcan applications only. Refer to the documentation for more information on thetypes of Vulcan applications.

## ðŸ“˜Note:

Note:

This feature is supported for native Vulcan applications only. Refer to the documentation for more information on thetypes of Vulcan applications.

#### Key Features of RBAC for Vulcan

1. Enhanced Security: RBAC ensures that only the necessary APIs are accessible to users, restricting unauthorised API calls and defining clear access scopes to improve application security.

2. Permission Enforcement: API access is controlled by assigned RBAC permissions. If a user lacks the required permissions, they cannot access or execute the API.

> ðŸš§Note:Duringapplication development, it is recommended to disable RBAC initially, complete the UI implementation, and then enable RBAC to whitelist the required APIs.

## ðŸš§Note:

Note:

Duringapplication development, it is recommended to disable RBAC initially, complete the UI implementation, and then enable RBAC to whitelist the required APIs.

To enable RBAC for a Vulcan microsite, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to theRBAC Detailssection.

Navigate to theRBAC Detailssection.

2. Enable RBAC by selectingYesunderEnable RBAC.

Enable RBAC by selectingYesunderEnable RBAC.

3. Map a permission to the Vulcan API call by selecting the appropriate permission in thePermissiondrop-down and mapping it to the corresponding Vulcan API endpoint. Permissions define specific actions a user can perform within the system. For example, theVULCAN_DELETE_APPLICATIONpermission allows a user to delete a Vulcan application on the Vulcan UI.ðŸ“˜Note:Creating an individual permission is currently unsupported. You can only choose from the list of existing permissions available on the Capillary platform.
