# Create rewardpost

This API is used to create the reward.

> 👍NoteFor detailed information about our APIs and for hands-on testing, refer documentation inAPI overviewand  step-by-step guide on making your first API call inMake your first API call.The parameters "group", "label", and "tier" clear their associated filters when the value is set as blank, setting the filter to null.Start time and end time are in UTC time zone.There is no limit on the number of rewards you can create.Linking a reward- You can link a reward to the card associated with the customer, customer label, customer segments, tiers, or desired loyalty programs. You cannot link same reward to more than one of these at a time. However, you can link same reward to different segments card seriesor others simultaneously.Example: You can link a reward to multiple card series, like "Gold Card Series" and "Platinum Card Series," at the same time. Similarly, you can link a reward to multiple labels, such as "VIP Customers" and "Frequent Buyers." However, you cannot link a reward to both a specific card, like "Gold Card," and a label, such as "VIP Customers," at the same time.New brands should no longer use the"Intouch Points"field. Instead, they should only use the new"paymentConfig"block.
