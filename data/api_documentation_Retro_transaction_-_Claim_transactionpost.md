# Overview

The Retro Transaction Request API enables the retrospective tagging of non-tagged transactions to existing members in the system. This endpoint allows the addition of retro transactions, converting untagged 'NOT_INTERESTED' transactions to 'REGULAR' transactions and assigning them to existing customers. This is particularly useful for cases where transactions were initially not linked to any member and need to be tagged to an existing customer now. For more information on retro transactions, refer to the documentationhere.

# Configuring standard workflow

You can configure the standard workflow and configure the below actions.

## Auto approval

You can set theAuto-approval flag : On/OfftoOnto enable auto approval for the retro transaction requests.

`Auto-approval flag : On/Off`

`On`

When the Auto-approval flag is enabled,

- Requests move directly from the "Pending" status to "Approved" status without requiring manual intervention.

- The approved requests are executed without the need for manual approval.

If the Auto-approval flag is disabled:

- Requests remain in the "Pending" status until they are manually approved.

- In a single-approval workflow, a request is initially created in the pending state by a Maker.

- A Checker is responsible for reviewing and approving or rejecting the request.

- Once approved, the request transitions to the Approved status, triggering the execution of the transaction claims API call.

- If the execution is successful, the request is marked as "Success". Otherwise, it is marked as "Failure" along with an appropriate error reason stored alongside the request.

Note:If the request is initiated using Connect-plus or via External services, the request validation bypasses the maker access validation and moves the request to the Approved state.

# API endpoint example

`[<https://eucrm.cc.capillarytech.com/api_gateway/v2/request-workflow/RETRO-TRANSACTION

# Prerequisites

- Authentication: Basic or OAuth authentication

- Default access group

- Maker request access (CanMakeRequest). Contact admin for access.

- The transaction must not exceed the TXN_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS parameter set by the brand. "TXN_MAX_ALLOWED_AGE_DAYS" refers to the maximum allowed age of a transaction in terms of days.

- The customer being tagged to the transaction should have registered RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS hours before the current time. "RETRO_DELAY_SINCE_REGISTRATION_HOURS" represents the delay in hours since a customer's registration before they can be associated with a retro transaction. It indicates the minimum amount of time that must pass after a customer registers before they can be retroactively linked to a transaction. For instance, if you set this value to 3 hours and a customer registers at 9:00 AM, they will be able to change their not-interested to transactions with billing times later than 6:00 AM but not before 5:59 AM.
