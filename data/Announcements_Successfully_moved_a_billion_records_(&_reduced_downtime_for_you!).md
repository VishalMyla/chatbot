# Successfully moved a billion records (& reduced downtime for you!)

| Hi there,Managing loyalty for a large organization, one with a few million customer records is hard. Many loyalty software, including ours, typically take a few hours to even upload all the data to servers. This means a few hours of downtime before end-users can reliably extract insights or find available data.Typically, the higher the data volume, the longer the downtime–unless loyalty software companies can figure out an engineering breakthrough, as we did.Reach out to our CSMs to learn more.Until next time. |  |  |  | Hi there,Managing loyalty for a large organization, one with a few million customer records is hard.
