Improving conversions with funnel charts ðŸ“Š

Understanding where customers are dropping off helps you improve customer experience, retention, and conversion. The sharpest decline in funnel size indicates thatâ€™s the bottleneck that needs to be tackled.

Each step can have multiple indicators of spaces for improvement. Eg:âž¡  Sharp decline at second stage:could be attributed to various reasons like broken links, poor email deliverability, server problem, etc.âž¡  Sharp decline at last step: could be because of a poor experience, a slow site, unexpected costs, or other factors.

Some of the most common funnel charts are built around:âž¡  Email promotion funnelsâž¡  Website purchase funnelsâž¡  Ad campaign funnels

But the beauty of these charts is that these can be configured for any sequence of events!

Getting this visual insight into any funnel gives you the edge your competitors are only still dreaming about. Ready to live the dream? See how you can set it up all by yourselfhere, or speak to your Capillary partners to get you going.
