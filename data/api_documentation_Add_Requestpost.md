# Add Requestpost

Requests, when submitted, will be in pending status by default. Capillary back-end team verifies the request and could either approves or rejects it. Therequest/addAPI allows you to directly process a request by passing a query param client_auto_approve=true.

`request/add`

If client_auto_approve=true, the request will be created in pending status by default and then processed automatically.

However, requests can be approved automatically based on the following configs set on Member Care.

| Config | Description |

| --- | --- |

| CI_EMAIL_AUTO_APPROVE | Approves email id change requests automatically |

| CI_MOBILE_AUTO_APPROVE | Approves mobile number change requests automatically |

| CI_EXTID_AUTO_APPROVE | Approves external id change requests automatically |

| CI_ADDRESS_AUTO_APPROVE | Approves registered address change requests automatically |
