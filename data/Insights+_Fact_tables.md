# Fact tables

Fact and dimension tables form the foundation for all reporting conducted within Insights+.

Fact tables contain quantitative data, typically numerical values that represent the measurements or metrics of a business process. For instance, in a sales environment, a fact table might record each sale transaction, with columns representing details such as transaction ID, sale amount, product ID, and date of sale. Each row in the fact table corresponds to a unique event or transaction and often references multiple dimension tables, which provide context to the facts.
