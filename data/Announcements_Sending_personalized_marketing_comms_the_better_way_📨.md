| Hi {{custom_tag_1}}, |

| Ten years ago, sending out seasonal promotions was the surest way to be remembered by your customers. Wishing them on their birthdays came second. That just doesnâ€™t cut it in 2024. Your customers are expecting hyper-personalized marketing comms that cut through the noise, IN REAL-TIME. That could sound like a feat only magicians could pull off. But marketers like you, with Capillaryâ€™s magic wand can do it too. |

|  |

| Hereâ€™s why Capillary Journeys is better than the old way of work. You: |

| 1. Remove the guesswork from drafting real-time campaign messages |

| Predicting future customer actions and preparing marketing messages that land is a lot of guesswork. The problem? Guesses are often wrong. |

| Journeys AI automatically predicts customer behaviors based on past interactions(99% accuracy rate), and lets you create marketing communications for future customer actions. Plus, you get to A/B test your messages, see which messages perform better, and then send them to a larger audience,all from a single workflow,eliminating guesswork. |

| 2. Engage intentionally, across channels, across multiple touchpoints |

| All your potential buyers wonâ€™t be in-market all the time. |

| With Journeys, you can send them marketing communications at every conceivable touchpoint, while also accurately mapping customer behaviors to intent. |

| So, the next time you see your customer hover over the â€˜Add to Cartâ€™ button you know they are likely to buy the product, and can send them a promotion. If they donâ€™t buy the product, you could follow it up with an abandoned cart email after 3 days to nudge them. And if they still donâ€™t buy, you could send an-in app message to remind them to buy too. |
