# Getting Started with Rewards Catalog

Note : Rewards catalog is based on API first architecture, so brands can directly use the APIs to create, update and view the rewards.

# Prerequisite

- Marvel Rewards should be enabled for the orgTo enable, create a JIRA request to the Capillary Product Support Team with the following info:Org IDTill ID. Onboarding can be performed for only one Till in an org. The till code is necessary for onboarding organizations in Marvel because it enables the Gamification application to make an InTouch API call. This call validates the customer by retrieving their details and ensuring they are valid. Without the till code, the Gamification application cannot perform this validation during the onboarding process.

a. Type - Select the type of reward you want to create (e.g., points, voucher, free voucher). This is just a metadata.

1. Vouchers: Digital coupons generated against redeeming customer points. For example, redeem 50 points for a 10% off coupon.

2. Physical voucher: Physical coupons generated against redeeming customer points. For example, redeem 150 points for a flat 150 off coupon.

3. Free voucher: Digital coupons generated without any points redemption.

b. Priority - Set the priority level for the reward (e.g., high, medium, low or 1, 2, 3, 4 and so on). This is a metadata for the reward.

c. Category - Select the category for the reward (e.g., fashion, electronics, groceries). You can create the categories in the category section in Marvel. This is a metadata for the reward.

d. Subscription - This is not working and to be ignored while creating a reward.

![](https://files.readme.io/916cba9-image5.png)

e. Advanced Filtering - Use filters such as tier, group, or label to specify the target audience for the reward. This is a metadata for the reward. The character limit for tiers, groups, and labels is 255 characters each.

f. Intouch Points - Define the number of intouch points required to purchase a reward.

g. Redemption type - Define the redemption type if it is intouch reward or vendor reward or cart promotion.

1. InTouch only rewards: These are points or coupons created in Capillary and uses Capillary APIs.

2. Vendor only rewards: These are either points or coupons created at the vendor end. Capillary uses vendor specific APIs directly to identify and issue rewards. In this case, there will be no data at the Intouch side and redemption doesn‚Äôt happen in Capillary.I

3. Vendor Intouch reward:

> üößAttentionIt is not recommended to use theVendor Intouch rewardredemption type. Instead, you can use theVendor only rewardredemption type to issue coupons directly through the vendor API.

## üößAttention

Attention

It is not recommended to use theVendor Intouch rewardredemption type. Instead, you can use theVendor only rewardredemption type to issue coupons directly through the vendor API.

`Vendor Intouch reward`

`Vendor only reward`

Here, the system will use the vendor specific API to issue vendor coupons and after receiving a successful response from the API, the system will use thecapillary issue couponAPI to issue coupons and retrieve the coupon codes. This redemption type helps to track the number of coupons issued to customers through the vendor system.

1. Cart Promotion rewards: These are promotions created in Capillary.

h. Vendor and vendor redemption

![](https://files.readme.io/9d133c0-image4.png)

In Vendor redemption, you can configure rewards linked to a particular vendor. You can also configure multiple actions in a single vendor redemption, for example, one to check if the customer has points and another to issue the reward.

> ‚ùóÔ∏èNote:Ensure that an external points system (e.g., Bonus Link) is configured when enabling external points redemption at the organization level. If external points APIs are not configured, the "Create Reward" option in the UI will remain disabled.

Begin by creating the reward partners. Navigate to the rewards vendor section

![](https://files.readme.io/df3b3f3-image6.png)

1. Click on the plus icon and assign a name to your reward partner, such as "target". Assign key-value pairs to the target. These will be used in all vendor redemptions created in subsequent steps. You can add frequently used fields as key-value pairs here. Then, click on save and create the vendor.

![](https://files.readme.io/7542727-image2.gif)

1. With the vendor created, select "target" and create vendor redemptions. Vendor redemption under vendor means specific APIs for the target will be called, created as a partner reward, and later linked to the catalog item.

![](https://files.readme.io/9b46d36-image5.gif)

1. Click on the plus icon and assign a name to your vendor redemption. Choose the type of reward, such as miles, cash wallet, cashback card, discount, charity games, vouchers, sweepstakes, auction, etc.
