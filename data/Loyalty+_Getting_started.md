# Getting started

## Introduction

Promotions are special loyalty programs that can run for a short period of time by rewarding customers with something extra from their basic loyalty programs. For example, you can drive sales through promotion programs by rewarding additional points or coupons to customers during a festival season or promoting a specific product.You can run promotion programs either at a transaction level, line item level, or customer level. Based on the event, the promotion type varies automatically. For example, in customer events, you cannot create transaction promotions and vice versa.

> ðŸ“˜You cannot create promotion programs for all events. For example, you cannot create promotions on events, ReturnTransaction, TransactionUpdate, DelayedAccrual, SlabUpgrade, and all group events (such as GroupTransactionAdd, GroupTransactionUpdate, GroupReturnTransaction, GroupMemberJoin, and GroupMemberLeave).You can create transaction or transaction line-item promotions only for the TransactionAdd event. For all other applicable events, you can create only customer-level promotion programs.

# Advanced Settings

### Points Allocation limits

These limits or capping let you budget the points that will be allocated via these promotions. This can done in various ways & combinations :

![](https://files.readme.io/6c30286-Screenshot_2024-04-23_at_3.40.44_PM.png)

- Maximum number of point activities for a member - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points to a customer from the promotion. Eg - This promotion can be applied to a customer maximum 3 times.

- Maximum points to be allocated in a single activity - Define the max points that can be allocated in an event or customer activity. Eg - This promotion can only allocate 100 points in a transaction.

- Maximum points to be allocated to a member - Define the max points that can be allocated to a customer from the promotion.  Eg - A customer can earn only upto 500 points from this promotion .

- Maximum points to be allocated from overall promotion - Define the max points that can be allocated from this promotion. Eg - The promotion can allocate upto 5000 points. This means, once 5000 points have been awarded from this promotion, it will be exhausted.

### Limits when Advance Promotions capabilities are enabled

![](https://files.readme.io/6ff532d-gif_1.gif)

When Advance Loyalty Promotions feature is enabled, these points allocation limits become more flexible and provides wider variety of limits to be configured.

The key differentiator here, are the specific time durations for these limits. You can define these limits apply within :

Promotion Duration- This ideally means, that there is no specific time duration set in this case, because these limits are anyways applicable for the time promotion is active.

a day- Setting this means the limit is applicable within a day or 24 hours. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 24 hours/a day and check if the limits is reached. Eg - Allocate 100 points to a customer from a promotion in a day. So in a day, a customer can only get 100 points from this promotion and event if the customer performs multiple events within the 24 hours duration, on every event, the system will go back and check for 24 hours.

in last 7 days- Setting this means the limit is applicable within last 7 days or a week. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 7 days and check if the limits is reached. Please be mindful, it is not a fixed window, where you are defining a week from Monday to Sunday. On every event occurrence , the system will go back 7 days and check for the limit value.

in last 30 days-  Setting this means the limit is applicable within last 30 days or a month. This behaves in a moving window format, so whenever the promotion event occurs, from that instance, the system will go back 30 days and check if the limits is reached. Please be mindful, it is not a fixed window, where you are defining a month from 1st to 30th. On every event occurrence , the system will go back 30 days and check for the limit value.

Limits :

Individual activity limit

- Max. points allocation per occurrence of activity - Define the max points that can be allocated in an event or customer activity. Eg - This promotion can only allocate 100 points in a transaction.

Individual customer limit

- Max. points allocation per customer across purchases - Define the max points that can be allocated to a customer from the promotion.  Eg - A customer can earn only upto 500 points from this promotion .

- Max. no. of activities per customer that can allocate points - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points to a customer from the promotion. Eg - This promotion can be applied to a customer maximum 3 times.

Across customers limit

- Max. points allocation across customers - Define the max points that can be allocated from this promotion. Eg - The promotion can allocate upto 5000 points. This means, once 5000 points have been awarded from this promotion, it will be exhausted.

- Max. no. of activities across customers that can allocate points - Define the max events or customer activities that can allocate points across customers from the promotion. Eg - This promotion allocates to total 500 transactions.

## Create Forward Cases (to Another Set)

To check multiple conditions at a time, use the Forward to Set action as explained in the following.

1. After writing therule expression, andExpression equals, set the action asForward to Set.

![](https://files.readme.io/b6f1f7f-Screenshot_126.png)

1. ClickForward to Setfrom the list.

2. SetEnable lineitem unrolling?to Yes to create rules based on transaction line items. SetEnable payment method unrolling?to Yes to create rules on payment modes.

![](https://files.readme.io/aa1d6ad-Screenshot_121.png)

1. To create rules based on line-items in the forward set (set2), setEnable lineitem unrollerto Yes; to create rules based on payment mode in the forward set(set2, setEnable payment method unrollerto Yes.

2. For the lineitem unroller, you will see theUse lineitem Proportions?option. This option lets you issue points on line items based on the line item amount.Assume a transaction with two lineitems, where lineitem1 is $800 and lineitem2 is $1200; bill level discount is $400. Hence, the total bill amount is $1600.If points allocation is set to 10% of the transaction amount, the allocation of points in the case ofUse Proportionsis as follows.

- IfUse Proportionsis disabled, points of 10% will be awarded for each line item. That is 80 points for lineitem1 and 120 points for lineitem2.

- IfUse Proportionsis enabled, points will be issued on proportionate of the bill amount. That is, for line item one - 10% of (800/2000)1600 and for lineitem2, it will be 10% off (1200/2000)1600.

1. TheMaximise Points Allocation?option considers the payment methods marked as eligible under 'Advanced Settings' and allocates points for the total eligible amount when different line items earn at different rate considering the higher earning first rather than a pro-rata basis
