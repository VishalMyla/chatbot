Coalition Loyalty

As the name suggests, coalition loyalty involves 2 or more businesses coming together to offer benefits in issuance, redemption or special privileges to their loyal customers. Itâ€™s one of the most appealing ways for marketers to grow their acquisition, retention and improve engagement.

Coalition loyalty is a smart investment for smart marketers. It offers a great ROI and boosts your existing loyalty program:

- ðŸ’°New and easy acquisition channel

By partnering up with another business, youâ€™re able to reach their loyal customers as well as yours. Thatâ€™s double the people you can reach out to in 1 go!  Moreover, this helps you mould better offerings with deeper insight into customer behaviors and purchase patterns across the ecosystem. Done smartly, it has the potential to impact all your key metrics at once.

- ðŸ˜ŠMore customer delight

With attractive partner offers, youâ€™re able to offer more to your existing customers. This helps increase customer delight and leaves more room for engagement.

- ðŸ›’Increased engagement and CLTV

Done right, when customers engage with either you or your partner organisation, you can grow. This could look like: an aviation company partnering up with a hotel chain. Or a retail apparel company partnering up with a retail accessories brand.

- ðŸ”’Non-compromised loyalty ownership

With coalition loyalty, there are only parts of overlap in the incentivization and tracking of your loyalty program. This means both you and your partner organisation continue having complete ownership of your own loyalty programs.

What can you do with Coalition Loyalty?

Creating a winning coalition loyalty program involves 3 simple steps:

1. Have your own loyalty program setup. Good thing youâ€™re already covered on this one.

2. Identifying partners that make sense. Your partners would be folks within a related space, but not your direct competitors.Eg: Airlines, Hotel chains. Apparel brand, Accessory brand. Sports accessories, gyms.

3. Building together. This involves mapping issuance, redemption or special privileges you can offer.

Eg: Automatic upgrades in hotels if youâ€™re an Airline partnerâ€™s Gold customer. Or point issuance on the first program if youâ€™re purchasing from a partner program. or even enjoying top tier benefits on being a partnerâ€™s loyal customer.

Now that you know this hack, why not ask your Capillary success partner to begin learning and implementing it?

Always creating avenues for your growth,
