# Key Insights from the Badges Earned Report

Majority Engagement from Lower TiersCustomers in lower sales ranges, especially the Base tier, account for nearly 80% of all badge earnings, indicating strong engagement at the lower end of the loyalty spectrum.

Peak Engagement PeriodJune 2024 has a high number of badges earned, suggesting successful campaigns or promotions during this time, particularly among Base and Silver customers.

Low Engagement in Premium TiersHigher-tier customers, such as those in Gold and Platinum, contribute significantly fewer badges, indicating a need for strategies to increase engagement.

Opportunities for Re-engagementBadge earnings are minimal in certain tiers, contributing only 1% or less, signalling an opportunity to re-engage these customers with targeted efforts.
