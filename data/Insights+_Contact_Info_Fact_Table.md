# Contact Info Fact Table

Whenever a campaign is run, the brand sends multiple messages to the customers. Each row in this fact table captures the communication that is done with the customer, as a part of the campaign. It captures data such as the date and time when the customer was contacted, the time when the customer accessed the campaign email, and the channel used for communication (like SMS, Whatsapp). This fact table is linked to multiple dimension tables, which store the communication related attributes.
