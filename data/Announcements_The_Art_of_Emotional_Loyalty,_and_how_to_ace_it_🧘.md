Hi there,

Rational or Transactional loyalty has proved to be an extremely effective way to create customer loyalty, riding on the structure that customers make purchases based on logical decision-making and economic incentives. However, the term loyalty itself refers to more of an emotion than a transaction.

Customers today are the ultimate surfers – hopping between different channels, devices, apps, and sites as they shop. Thus, when presented with so many choices, they rely on factors like brand experience, convenience, offers, price, and reviews to guide their purchases. This is where Emotional Loyalty comes into play.

Navigating through incorporating Emotional Loyalty into your loyalty strategies can be tricky to implement. Questions brands ask are – how will this impact be measured? How does one evaluate the results? How do we decide the next best actions based on this?

Well, here’s how Capillary helps you combine the best of both worlds.

1. Capture data streams📊

Create surveys for customers, partnered with text analysis / social listening capability that will help you evaluate the sentiment of the customer as well. This structured data can be ingested with ‘smart tags’ as well.

2. Analyse and create EL Scores 🕵️

Brands can create scores across 4 different core pillars of human relationships –Trust, appreciation, empathy, and shared values.

3. Run successful, meaningful campaigns 🚀

EL scores can be used s filters to create segments, behavioral aspects of these segments can be studied to build journeys and in-depth reports can be made with MemberCare data to optimize analysis.
A successful omni-channel campaign will interact with their customers where they are most responsive, and likely to make a purchase from.

Incorporating emotional loyalty into your customer-facing campaigns is the key to customer delight and long-term retention. It goes beyond building connections and humanizes your brand. Additionally, it ensures you stay true to your customer-facing values and earns their trust.

Building emotional loyalty takes time, but when you're in it for the long haul, values, and ethics become paramount. That's when your brand will be able to provide the most value and earn the most trust.

Helping you stay ahead of the curve,
