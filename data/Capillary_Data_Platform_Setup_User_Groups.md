# Setup User Groups

## Introduction

A user group comprises individuals in a hierarchical order who belong to a particular org. An individual can belong to multiple user groups. An org can designate different roles to these members and incentivize them according to the orgâ€™s preference. User group loyalty allows an org to incentivize not only its customers but also incentivize other business entities or individuals that contribute to their profits. It is a customer retention solution with custom group structures and includes generic loyalty mechanics which helps an org to establish brand loyalty.

In user group loyalty, an individualâ€™s (member of a group) action will lead to other group members being rewarded.

For example, if a fleet driver fills petrol from BPCL, the manager of the fleet group can receive points for the transaction.

This way of incentivizing the upper management encourages other members of the group to transact from an org.

## Difference between B2B and B2C

The existing user group programs (B2C or friends and family programs) only cater to customers and include family members and friends of these customers. These groups have a primary member who can redeem points and secondary members as well. In the B2C model, with the help of the Engage+ platform, orgs are able to directly benefit the primary member of the group, ignoring the secondary members. B2C model has only one primary member with multiple secondary associated.

The B2B user group programs aim to involve all members in the group actively by incentivizing everyone based on their roles in the group. B2B user group programs also include all the functionalities of the existing B2C programs.

## Use Cases
