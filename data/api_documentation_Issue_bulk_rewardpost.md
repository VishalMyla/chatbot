# Issue bulk rewardpost

This API is used to issue multiple rewards to the user based on mobile number/ email Id.

While issuing bulk rewards,

1. The intouch points required to purchase the rewards are summed up and isRedeemable call checks if the customer has enough points or not.If the customer has enough points, then all the rewards in the issue bulk call are issued in a single shotIf the customer doesn't have enough points, then the issue bulk call is failed and no reward is issued.

The intouch points required to purchase the rewards are summed up and isRedeemable call checks if the customer has enough points or not.

1. If the customer has enough points, then all the rewards in the issue bulk call are issued in a single shot

2. If the customer doesn't have enough points, then the issue bulk call is failed and no reward is issued.

4. If the isRedeemable call is successful, then the system will issue the rewards to the user.Let's say, one reward is coupon, another is cart promotion in the request payload. Coupon is issued but cart promotion issual failed, this can happen and the coupon will be issued. Here in this case, partial issual will be successful.

If the isRedeemable call is successful, then the system will issue the rewards to the user.

1. Let's say, one reward is coupon, another is cart promotion in the request payload. Coupon is issued but cart promotion issual failed, this can happen and the coupon will be issued. Here in this case, partial issual will be successful.

If no cards or labels are linked, rewards are still issued. A reward linked to a specific card series or label cannot be issued to a customer associated with a different card series or label.The Rewards system (Marvel/Rewards Catalogue)  only deducts points from the customer if the vendor reward issue is successful. As a result, the need to reverse redeemed points does not arise, as points are deducted only upon a confirmed successful reward issue. The success of the vendor reward issue is determined based on the following configuration criteria:HTTP Status Code:The API response must return a status code of 200.Context Map Validation:The context map in the vendor redemption configuration must include a keyword "voucher".

For more information and various examples, refer to the documentationhere.Notes:- If the quantity is entered with decimals, the system will not consider the decimal part. For example, if you enter the value 1.56, the system will disregard the .56, and the value will be treated as 1.The maximum allowed quantity is5for rewards of typeCONV_RATIOif either redemptionValue or points are not provided.- If both the quantity and redemption value are defined in the payment configuration block, the defined number of rewards will be issued and the calculation will be based on the redemption value for each reward.- If you define quantity without a redemption value, the system considers the quantity as the redemption value.

If redemption value is not provided, the system takes quantity as the redemption value. |

| customFields | Object | The list of custom fields associated with the reward issued to the customer. A custom field allows you to add extra information related to the reward.You can add the custom field in the issue reward call once the custom field is created using thecreate custom field API. |

# Example: Issuing reward with quantity and redemption value

Consider the below scenario:

- Quantity = 3

- Redemption Value = 1000 miles

- Conversion ratio = 044

Sample Payload:

```
{
    "mobile": "11223569865",
    "brand": "BUKL",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "rewardId": 311509,
            "quantity": 3,
            "paymentConfig": {
                "redemptionValue": 100
            }
        ]
    }
```

```
{
    "mobile": "11223569865",
    "brand": "BUKL",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "rewardId": 311509,
            "quantity": 3,
            "paymentConfig": {
                "redemptionValue": 100
            }
        ]
    }
```

Calculation:

Formula:Points need to be Redeemed = (redemption_value / conv_ratio) √ó reward_quantity

= (1000 / 0.44) √ó 3 = 6818 pointsResult: 6818 points are redeemed for 3 reward vouchers of 1000 miles each.

# Example: Issuing reward with only quantity

Consider the below scenario:

Quantity = 3

Conversion ratio = 044

The system interprets the quantity as the redemption value and reward quantity as 1.

Sample Payload:

```
{
    "mobile": "11223569865",
    "brand": "BUKL",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "rewardId": 308697,
            "quantity": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

```
{
    "mobile": "11223569865",
    "brand": "BUKL",
    "rewards": [
        {
            "rewardId": 308697,
            "quantity": 3
        }
    ]
}
```

Calculation:

Formula:Points need to be Redeemed = (redemption_value / conv_ratio) √ó reward_quantity

= (3 / 0.44) √ó 1 = 7 pointsResult: 7 points are redeemed for one reward voucher of 3 miles.

# Example: Issuing reward created for customer segment

Consider the following scenario:

| Reward | Segments and Partitions |

| --- | --- |

| r1 | {s1, p1}, {s2, p2} |

| r2 | {s1, p2}, {s2, p1} |

| r3 | {s1, p1}, {s3, p1} |

| r4 | No segments or partitions |



User Segments and Partitions:

| User | Belongs to Segments and Partitions | Reward details |

| --- | --- | --- |

| user1 | {s2, p1}, {s3, p2} | Does not contain r1, r3; contains r2, r4 |

| user2 | {s1, p1} | Contains r1, r3, r4; does not contain r2 |

| user3 | No segments or partitions | Contains r4 |



Bulk Issuance Results:

| User | Bulk Issuance (r1, r2, r3, r4) | Success/Failure |

| --- | --- | --- |

| user1 | r1, r2, r3, r4 | r1 and r3 fail; r2 and r4 are issued |

| user2 | r1, r2, r3, r4 | r2 fails; r1, r3, and r4 pass |

| user3 | r1, r2, r3, r4 | r1, r2, and r3 fail; r4 passes |
