- Referral campaign

- Bounceback or DVS Campaign

## Broadcast campaign

Broadcast campaigns are campaigns that are implemented to target a bulk audience. These campaigns' functioning depends on customers' historical data and behaviours. So we can actually launch the campaign by specifying the audience which we want to target for the specific campaign.

### Create campaign

Campaigns created on Engage+ can be used to reach out to customers through Omnichannel mediums like Line, Viber, SMS, Email etc.
