# Create a Campaign (Old UI)

# Type of Campaigns

You can create a campaign for different marketing objectives, such as Sales promotion, New Store openings, Brand anniversaries, Birthdays, and many others.So basically there are 6 types of campaigns.

- Broadcast campaign

- Journey campaign

- Timeline campaign

- Survey campaign

- Referral campaign

- Bounceback or DVS Campaign

## Broadcast campaign

Broadcast campaigns are campaigns that are implemented to target a bulk audience. These campaigns' functioning depends on customers' historical data and behaviours. So we can actually launch the campaign by specifying the audience which we want to target for the specific campaign.

### Create campaign

Engage+ new UI consists of a single campaign creation flow with different content strategies.  You can create a campaign either for the org or an org unit. There are three different user roles for org unit access.

- Access to parent org and its org units.

- Access to multiple org units but not org.

- Access only to a specific org unit.

Campaigns created on Engage+ can be used to reach out to customers through Omnichannel mediums like Line, Viber, SMS, Email etc.
