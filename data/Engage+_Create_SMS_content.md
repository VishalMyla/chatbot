## Enable link tracking for SMS

To understand the usage of links sent out through SMS campaigns, tracking of links in SMS is essential. Link tracking lets orgs capture metrics that state how many users have clicked on a link sent in SMS and the total number of clicks on a link.

Link tracking is not enabled by default. You need to create a ticket assigning it to the Capillary support team.

Due to the DLT compliance restrictions in India, you need to add the link through a variable tag only so that the whitelisted template does not get affected.

Once enabled, you can insert the link in SMS using the respective variable tag{#var#}.

This is applicable for

- One-time SMS campaign

- Recurring SMS campaign

- Coupon expiry reminders and messages resend

> ðŸ“˜Adding links outside the {#var#} tag will result in the template mismatch leading to delivery failure.

## ðŸ“˜

- Adding links outside the {#var#} tag will result in the template mismatch leading to delivery failure.

The system replaces the mentioned link with an internal tiny URL. The link added by the user would be transformed.

For example, if the link iswww.google.com, it could be changed to s.cplry.com/7383936D89.

Changing the link would also affect the characters of the SMS script.

For example, if the replaced link is 20-22 characters in length, the SMS character count can be changed by 15 characters (either add or remove).
