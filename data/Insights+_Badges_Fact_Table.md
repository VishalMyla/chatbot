# Badges Fact Table

# Introduction to Badges Fact Tables

Badges are a type of visual recognition used in loyalty programs to reward customers for their progress, specific actions or achievements. They act as a form of gamification and instill a sense of pride and accomplishment within the user, thus, reinforcing the targeted behaviors and boosting engagement.

For more information about how badges work in Capillary product suite, please refer to theBadges Documentation.  This part of the documentation covers how you can analyze and report on badges featured in the Capillary system.

There are a few crucial elements of Badges lifecycle which a user would like to track and analyze. They include events such as earning a badge (without enrolment), the issual of badge (based on enrolment) and the promotions linked with the badge. The information of these events are stored in the form of fact and dimension tables based on star schema.The fact tables store the details of these events and the corresponding dimension tables contain the fields on the basis of which the entries in these fact tables can be grouped/filtered for reporting.

## Badges - Earn (badges_earn)

Each row in this table represents an event in which a customer earns a badge on completing a specified activity or meeting a set of pre-defined criteria. This doesnâ€™t require the customer to enrol for the badge beforehand. It captures information like the badge ID, customer ID, earning date, expiry date, and whether the badge is active or revoked.

For example-When a customer registers, they automatically receive the "New Member" badge if the configuration specifies that pre-enrollment is not needed. These types of events are stored in the Badges_earn fact table.By linking this fact table with the dimension tables, you would be able to have a complete picture of this event.
