Hi there,

2 billion users use WhatsApp. Chances are most of your customers use WhatsApp. Not integrating WhatsApp in your loyalty program can be a glaring miss.

“But WhatsApp marketing isn’t easy, Capillary. Do you know how many steps there can be to getting just 1 promotion out?”

With Engage+, it’s almost as easy as sending an SMS campaign. No, really. Take 2 minutes to scroll and see for yourself.

Using Capillary vs any other BSP just makes sense. Especially if you want to:

- Save days worth of your time,

- Skip countless human errors,

- Onboard smoothly with WhatsApp

- Have no privacy or data-sharing concern

- Have an organised communication management.

All while shooting your conversion ratio by reaching your customers right where they’re most active.

Good marketers would jump on this already. Great marketers would jump on what’s next.

Not just broadcast. Deep personalisation, natively

When you reach your customers on a channel they’re most active on with something that speaks out personally to them, no other competitor can be a match to that.

Due to a ready-to-access database, creating the most targeted WhatsApp segments comes as easy as creating email segments with Capillary. Identify demographics, geography, customer preferences and tailor communication to each person.

Unparalleled WhatsApp-to-store ROI tracking

POS integration can be tough and expensive for BSPs. With Capillary, you not just get the performance report of your communication, but of its impact in real-time. Having already integrated with in-store POS, Capillary can help you map buyer purchases to WhatsApp promotions so you can see your ROI immediately.

There’s no way this hasn’t got you excited, is there? Talk to your Capillary partner today and begin your WhatsApp success journey.
