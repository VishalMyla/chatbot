# Cookies delivered! Is traditional marketing back?

| Hi there,One week ago, Google sent shockwaves across marketing teams worldwide by announcing it was rolling back its Privacy Sandbox initiative, effectively giving free reign to advertisers to use third-party cookies to track buyer behavior on websites. So, is pre-2020 marketing back? Not really.Google wrote an entire blog explaining their visionhere. Here‚Äôs the TLDR for those of us that didn‚Äôt read it: People will get to decide whether or not they want cookies to track them. Here‚Äôs how that‚Äôll impact marketing.1. Less real-time behavior tracking, more predictive behavior-analysisüîçCookies, or small bits of code tracking user behaviors across the web are key to many-a-behavioral-based campaigns. With customers now opting into third-party cookies, marketers will lose a lot of key behavioral information from a large faction of customers.For perspective, when Apple rolled out its version of Privacy Sandbox called App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework in 2021, only50% of Apple users opted-into ATT tracking.The solution? AI-based predictive behavioral tracking. Capillary, for instance, uses Aira to analyze your¬† customers‚Äô past purchase behaviors to accurately predict their intent based on their interaction at any communication touchpoint. Lesser dependency of real-time third-party cookie data, more time winning.2. Rise of multi-touchpoint interactive campaigns üö©The easiest way to collect customer intent data without using third-party cookies? Create multi-touchpoint campaigns and collect click and interaction data to understand customer intent.For instance, you could create a multi-touch campaign with messages to increase ATV.

All you need is a multi-touchpoint engagement orchestration platform to help you plan the program.Lucky you, Capillary helps you create multi-touchpoint interactive campaigns, across all channels, intuitive drag-and-drop UX, smart AI insights and top-notch reporting, accessible through Journeys.3.
