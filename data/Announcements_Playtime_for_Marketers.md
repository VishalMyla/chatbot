Hi there,

Outdated products for marketers take away the joy of creating impact by reducing it to mechanical setup efforts. But marketing shouldn’t be all boring UI, stress, and dread. While we can’t all sit back and sip scotch in our suits like Mad Men, doesn’t mean we can’t have some fun with it!

In 2023, the product team will build towards features, UI, and UX that make loyalty engagement so fun, it’ll feel like Playtime for marketers.
